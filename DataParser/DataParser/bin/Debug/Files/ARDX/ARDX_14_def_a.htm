As a result, we are mailing most of our stockholders a paper copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or the Notice, but not a paper copy of our proxy statement and our 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders. This process allows
us to provide our proxy materials to our stockholders in a timelier and more readily accessible manner, while reducing the environmental impact and lowering the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials. The Notice contains instructions
on how to access those documents over the internet. The Notice also contains instructions on how to request a paper copy of our proxy materials, including this proxy statement, our 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders and a form of proxy card or
voting instruction card. All stockholders who have previously requested a paper copy of our proxy materials will continue to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail. </P>

possible. You may vote over the internet or by a toll-free telephone number. If, however, you requested to receive paper proxy materials, then you may also vote by mailing a complete, signed and dated proxy card or voting instruction card in the
envelope provided. Please note that any stockholder attending the 2017 Annual Meeting may vote in person, even if the stockholder has already voted over the internet or by phone or returned a proxy card or voting instruction card by mail. </P>

mitigate or eliminate such risks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our board of directors does not have a standing risk management committee, but rather administers this oversight

responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure and our audit committee is responsible for overseeing our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures. The audit
committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Our nominating and corporate governance committee monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines and considers and approves or disapproves any
related-persons transactions. Our compensation committee assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. </P>

Executive Officer, unless such authority has been delegated to the compensation committee. Our executive officers submit proposals to the board of director and compensation committee regarding our executive and director compensation. The
compensation committee also approves grants of stock options and other awards under our stock plans. The compensation committee has delegated authority to the Chief Executive Officer to grant stock options to purchase shares of common stock to
existing and new <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-senior</FONT> management team employees, with such individual grants to be consistent with equity grant guidelines provided by our compensation consultant and approved by the compensation

Securities Purchase Agreement on the same terms as shares were offered and sold to other purchasers. In addition, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the principal stockholders and the other purchasers pursuant to which we agreed to
prepare and file a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale of all of the shares purchased under the Securities Purchase agreement and any shares of common stock issued as a divided or other distribution with respect to those

COMPENSATION </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2014, our board of directors approved a compensation policy for our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT>
directors, or the Director Compensation Program. Pursuant to the Director Compensation Program, we do not pay director fees to directors who are employees and for 2016 our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> directors received an
annual retainer of $35,000. Any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> Chairman will receive an additional annual cash retainer in the amount of $25,000 per year. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-employee</FONT> directors receive
additional annual retainers of $10,000 for serving on the audit committee (or $20,000 for serving as the chair of the audit committee), $7,500 for serving on the compensation committee (or $15,000 for serving as the chair of the compensation
committee) and $4,000 for serving on the nominating and corporate governance committee (or $8,000 for serving as the chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee). Retainers are paid to our
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> directors on the date of our annual stockholders meeting or, in respect of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> directors appointed to our board of directors after the annual
stockholders meeting, on the date of appointment but <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pro-rated</FONT> to reflect the number of whole or partial months remaining until the next annual stockholders meeting. In March 2017, our compensation committee
recommended, and our board of directors approved, an increase in the annual retainer for our non-employee directors to $40,000 following a periodic assessment of our Director Compensation Program by the compensation committee, with analysis and
recommendations by Pearl Meyer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In lieu of a cash retainer, each <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> director will also have the ability
to elect to receive a stock award consisting of that number of fully vested shares of common stock calculated by dividing the amount of the cash retainer by the fair market value of the common stock on the date of our annual meeting of stockholders.
For 2016, each of Messrs. Bertrand, Mott and Rodgers elected to receive a stock award in lieu of their respective 2016 annual cash retainers as calculated pursuant to the preceding sentence. Members of our board of directors are also reimbursed for
reasonable travel and other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-pocket</FONT></FONT> expenses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon initial
appointment or election to our board of directors, under the Director Compensation Program in effect for 2016 each <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> director was automatically granted an option to purchase 25,000 shares of our
common stock. In addition, each continuing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> director who has been serving on our board of directors for at least six months as of the date of any annual meeting of our stockholders and will
continue to serve as a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> director immediately following such meeting is automatically granted an option to purchase 15,000 shares of our common stock on the date of each annual stockholders meeting.
Each initial <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> director stock option vests with respect to 1/36th of the shares on each monthly anniversary of the grant date, subject to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT>
director&#146;s continued service on our board of directors through such date. Each annual stock option granted to our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> directors, vests with respect to 1/12th of the shares on each monthly
anniversary of the grant date, subject to acceleration in full immediately prior to the next annual stockholders meeting, subject to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> director&#146;s continued service on our board of directors
through such date. The Director Compensation Program also provides that upon a &#147;Change in Control&#148; of Ardelyx (as defined in our equity incentive plan), all outstanding equity awards granted under an equity incentive plan maintained by
Ardelyx that are held by a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> director will become fully vested and/or exercisable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2017, our
compensation committee recommended, and our board of directors approved, an increase in the initial option grant for newly appointed non-employee directors to 30,000 shares following the periodic assessment of our Director Compensation Program by
our compensation committee, with analysis and recommendations by Pearl Meyer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During 2016, Mr.&nbsp;Bazemore was granted an initial option to purchase
25,000 shares of our common stock in connection with his appointment to our board of directors in June 2016, and our remaining <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> directors each was granted an annual option to purchase 15,000 shares

rates based on each participating executive&#146;s experience in her or his role with our company and the level of responsibility held by each executive, which the board of directors or our compensation committee believe directly correlates to her
