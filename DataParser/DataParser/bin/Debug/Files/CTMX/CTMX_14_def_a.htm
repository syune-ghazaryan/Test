regarding how to instruct the organization to vote your shares. If you do not give instructions to your broker, bank or other agent, it can vote your shares with respect to &#147;discretionary&#148; items but not with respect to
&#147;non-discretionary&#148; items. Discretionary items are proposals considered routine under the rules of various national securities exchanges, and, in the absence of your voting instructions, your broker, bank or other agent may vote your
shares held in street name on such proposals. Non-discretionary items are proposals considered non-routine under the rules of various national securities exchanges, and, in the absence of your voting instructions, your broker, bank or other agent
may not vote your shares held in street name on such proposals and the shares will be treated as broker non-votes. Proposal 1 is a matter considered non-routine under the applicable rules. If you do not give your broker specific instructions, the
broker may not vote your shares on Proposal 1 and your shares will constitute broker non-votes which will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists but will not affect the outcome of these proposals. Proposal 2 involves a matter
we believe to be routine and thus if you do not give instructions to your broker, the broker may vote your shares in its discretion on Proposal 2 and therefore no broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection with Proposal 2. </P>

Frederick W. Gluck and Matthew P. Young, whose terms of office expire upon the election of directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Each of Neil Exter, Frederick W. Gluck and Matthew P. Young, the current directors in Class II, have

the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2017 and has further directed that management submit the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the stockholders at the annual meeting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
has audited our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement

ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the audit committee will reconsider whether or not to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee,
in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the committee determines that such a change would be in our best interests and our stockholders&#146; best
interest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy

directors is &#147;independent&#148; as that term is defined under the NASDAQ rules. Our board of directors determined that Frederick W. Gluck, a member of our audit committee and compensation committee, Matthew P. Young, a member of our audit
committee and nominating and corporate governance committee, John Scarlett, M.D., a member of our audit and compensation committees, Neil Exter and Marion McCourt, members of our compensation committee, and Hoyoung Huh, M.D., Ph.D., a member of our

provide fixed cash compensation to our executive officers for performing daily responsibilities, and also provide stability and security. We establish base salaries for our executive officers when they join us or upon promotion. In addition, base
salaries for executive officers are reviewed and determined by the compensation committee on an annual basis, in consultation with our independent compensation consultant, Radford. Such annual adjustments are based on factors which may include each
executive officer&#146;s position and specific responsibilities, individual performance, level of experience, achievement of corporate and strategic goals, and a review of competitive salary, total compensation market data, and cost of living
increases in the San Francisco Bay Area. The compensation committee does not apply any specific formulas to determine increases in base salaries for our executive officers, but instead makes an evaluation of each executive officer&#146;s
contributions to CytomX&#146;s long-term success. Generally, any increase in base salary beyond a cost of living increase is based on an evaluation of the individual&#146;s performance, changes in responsibilities or position and the
individual&#146;s criticality to our future plans. Increases in base salary, including cost of living increases, typically take effect on January&nbsp;1st&nbsp;of each calendar year. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, we have provided our executives with short-term incentive compensation through our annual bonus program. We believe that annual

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the beginning of each year, the Chief Executive Officer develops, with input from our executive management, the annual corporate goals,
which generally relate to our operational and financial objectives, and individual performance goals (other than for himself) together with recommended weightings for each goal, and presents the annual corporate and individual goals and recommended
weightings to the compensation committee and the board of directors. The weighting for each goal depends on its importance and business value for CytomX and our stockholders. The board reviews the corporate and individual goals and weightings and
adjusts them as necessary prior to approval. Our 2016 annual cash bonus program provided cash incentive awards for the achievement of research and development, business development, and company culture goals (weighted 65%, 25% and 10%, respectively)

approved by the board of directors. The research and development portion of the 2016 annual cash bonus program included specific strategic goals relating to the further development of clinical
candidates and product pipelines, while the business development portion of the 2016 program included goals relating to strategic partner collaborations. The 2016, the compensation committee set individual performance goals that it intended would to
require significant effort on the part of our NEOs to satisfy and, therefore, set these targets at levels they believed would be difficult to achieve, such that average or below average performance would not satisfy these targets. The 2016 cash
bonus program also included goals related to the company culture, systems and teamwork. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under our cash bonus plan, each of our executive
officers has an established annual incentive bonus target, which is equal to a percentage of their base salary. This percentage increases as levels of responsibility and title increase. Actual earned annual incentive bonus, if any, is calculated
based on corporate goal achievement. As a percentage of base salary, the 2016 target bonus for Dr.&nbsp;McCarthy, Mr.&nbsp;Goeltz, Dr.&nbsp;Humphrey and Dr.&nbsp;Kavanaugh was 50%, 35%, 35% and 35%, respectively. This practice is designed to create
a direct link between executive compensation and achievement of operational and financial objectives to provide motivation for executive officers to implement strategic initiatives intended to meet or exceed pre-established corporate goals. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the annual year-end performance review process, the compensation committee, taking into consideration recommendations from the
Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the overall achievement of our corporate and individual goals during the preceding year and other significant company and individual accomplishments, while taking into consideration the degree of difficulty in
achieving the corporate goals and any particular events or circumstances that impacted performance. The corporate goal achievement factor generally ranges from 50% to 150% and is approved by the board upon recommendation from the compensation
committee based upon the board&#146;s assessment of the company&#146;s achievement of that year&#146;s annual corporate goals. The board has the discretion to approve a corporate goal achievement factor above 150% in extraordinary circumstances
where it determines such an increase is warranted. The annual incentive bonus for each of our NEOs, is primarily based on the corporate goal achievement factor and then is augmented (either positive or negative) by individual performance, as
evaluated by the compensation committee in its sole discretion. The Chief Executive Officer presents to the compensation committee written assessments of the corporate and individual performance and achievements, including support of our corporate
values, for each of the executive officers (other than himself) for the prior year and recommends performance awards for each executive officer (other than himself). The compensation committee reviews the performance recommendations for each of the
executive officers and adjusts the factors as necessary prior to approval. There are no minimum or guaranteed bonus payments for employees, including the Named Executive Officers. Based on our corporate performance and individual performance, the
compensation committee certified the annual bonus amounts set forth in the table below for each NEO in 2016, along with their target bonus award: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

performance goals and driving growth in our stock price and long-term value creation and to help us to attract and retain key talent. Equity awards are designed to encourage high performance by and long-term tenure for executive officers, thereby

and align the interests of stockholders and employees. Only through sustained, increasing price per share performance in our Common Stock, can our employees, including the NEOs, have an
opportunity to realize any value from equity-based awards. The compensation committee determines the size of any stock option grant according to each executive officer&#146;s position. To do so, the compensation committee generally references the
market data provided by Radford. The compensation committee also takes into consideration each NEO&#146;s recent performance history, his or her potential for future responsibility, and criticality of his or her work to the long-term success of the
Company. Other factors may include equity awards previously granted, the amount of actual versus theoretical equity value per year that has been derived to date by the individual, the current actual value of unvested equity grants for each
individual, the percentage of stock option grants with exercise prices greater than CytomX&#146;s current stock price and the number of stock option grants that have expired unexercised as a result of market conditions. The compensation committee
has the discretion to give relative weight to each of these factors as it sets the size of the stock option grant to appropriately create an opportunity for reward based on increasing stockholder value. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The compensation committee grants equity awards to newly hired and existing executive officers. Our general policy is to grant stock options
and other equity awards on fixed dates determined in advance, although there are occasions when grants are made on other dates. All required approvals are obtained in advance of or on the actual grant date. Other than stock option grants to new
hires, stock option grants to executive officers are generally approved once a year (typically near the beginning of the year) unless an executive officer is promoted, in which case a grant will normally be made at the time of such promotion, or, in
rare circumstances, for recognition of outstanding performance. With respect to annual stock option grants to our continuing executive officers, these grants are typically approved early in each fiscal year and prior to the full release of our
annual financial and operating results for that year. As a result, the timing of annual equity awards to our continuing executive officers is not coordinated in a manner that intentionally benefits our executive officers; rather, the policy is
designed with the objective to generally allow the market price of our common stock to reflect our then-current results and prospects at the time the annual equity grant becomes effective and the exercise price is set. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The exercise price of all stock option grants is equal to the closing price of CytomX Common Stock as reported by the NASDAQ on the date of
grant, so executive officers who receive stock option grants do not realize any compensation from such stock option grants unless the stock price increases above the exercise price. In this manner, the interests of our stockholders, and executive
officers during their employment, are aligned for the long-term success of the company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CytomX&#146;s standard vesting schedule for the
first stock option grant awarded to newly hired employees, including executive officers, provides that 25% of the shares granted will vest on the first anniversary of the commencement of employment, with the balance vesting in equal monthly
installments over the subsequent thirty-six (36)&nbsp;months, until option shares are fully vested, subject to the individual&#146;s continued service to us through the applicable vesting date. Additional option grants made after an employee,
including an executive officer, has provided services to the company for more than one year generally vest monthly from the date of grant over four years, subject to the individual&#146;s continued service to us through the applicable vesting date.

Dr.&nbsp;Kavanaugh for the purchase of up to 225,000, 80,000, 65,000 and 80,000 shares of our common stock, respectively. These option grants were determined after considering the competitive labor market as well as the vested portion of prior

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have entered into a written offer letters with each of the NEOs when they join the company setting forth the terms of their employment.
This offer describes the basic terms of the executive&#146;s employment, including his or her initial base compensation, annual bonus target, option awards and any fringe benefits. Each of our NEOs is employed &#147;at will.&#148;
Dr.&nbsp;Humphrey&#146;s offer letter, as amended, also provides that we will (i)&nbsp;reimburse Dr.&nbsp;Humphrey&#146;s housing and travel expense reimbursements for her commute from her principal residence in New Jersey to our headquarters in
South San Francisco, California, (ii)&nbsp;provide her a daily transportation allowance of $100, (iii)&nbsp;pay an addition $3,500 per month to spend on the housing or lodging of her choice until October&nbsp;31, 2016 and (iv)&nbsp;not reimburse any
housing costs over $3,500. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our NEOs are entitled to certain severance and change in control benefits under the terms of individual
severance and change of control agreements and our equity plans. These severance and change in control provisions are intended to allow employees, including NEOs, to focus their attention on the business operations of CytomX in the face of the
potentially disruptive impact of a proposed change in control transaction, to assess takeover bids objectively without regard to the potential impact on their own job security and to allow for a smooth transition in the event of a change in control
of CytomX. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The compensation committee believes that the severance benefits we offer remain essential to fulfill the objectives to
recruit, retain and develop key management talent in the competitive San Francisco Bay Area employment market. These arrangements enable us to recruit and retain high-quality management talent because they provide reasonable protection to the
executive officer in the event that he or she is not retained under limited circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the case of Dr.&nbsp;McCarthy, his Amended
and Restated Severance and Change of Control Agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by us without cause or if Dr.&nbsp;McCarthy terminates his employment due to good reason (as such terms are defined in his agreement), subject to
his execution of a general release of claims against the company, he will be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to one year of base salary plus his target annual bonus for such calendar year pro-rated based on his termination date as well
as continued medical and dental coverage for a period of one year following termination of employment or, to the extent we are unable to provide such benefit coverage, a lump sum payment equal to the annualized premium cost relating to such benefit
coverage. Dr.&nbsp;McCarthy&#146;s agreement also provides that, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the agreement) and a termination of employment without cause or due to good reason within 60 days prior to or 12 months following
such change of control, Dr.&nbsp;McCarthy will be entitled to receive the same benefits, except that the lump sum payment will equal 18 months of his then current base salary plus 18 months of his target annual bonus for such calendar year,
continued medical and dental coverage will be for 18 months and full vesting of his outstanding equity awards. In addition, upon a change of control, the performance goal stipulated in any performance-based equity awards held by Dr.&nbsp;McCarthy
will be deemed achieved in full. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Amended and Restated Severance and Change in Control Agreements entered into with each of our other
named executive officers other than Dr.&nbsp;McCarthy provide that if the officer&#146;s employment is terminated by us without cause or if the officer terminates his or her employment due to good reason (as such terms are defined in the Severance
Agreements), subject to his or her execution of a general release of claims against the company, he or she will be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to nine-months of base salary plus his or her target annual bonus for such calendar year
pro-rated based on his termination date as well as continued medical and dental coverage for a period of nine months following termination of employment or, to the extent we are unable to provide such benefit coverage, a lump sum payment equal to
the premium cost relating to such benefit coverage. The Severance Agreements entered into with each of our other named executive officers other than Dr.&nbsp;McCarthy also provide that, in the event the officer is terminated without cause or
terminates due to good reason, in each case within 60 days prior to or 12 months following a change in control, then the officer will be entitled to receive the benefits described in the preceding sentence, except that the lump sum payment will
equal 12 months of his then current base salary plus 12 months of his target annual bonus for such calendar year, continued medical and dental coverage will be for 12 months and full vesting of his outstanding equity awards. </P>

payment or other benefit provided to the officer pursuant to the Severance Agreement constitutes a &#147;excess parachute payment&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;280G of the Code, and would be subject to an excise tax imposed by
Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code, then the amounts actually paid to the officer will be reduced to the extent that such a reduction would result in the officer receiving a greater amount than he or she would have received if the payment had been made

amounts. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the audit committee&#146;s approval of the scope of the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm or on an individual explicit case-by-case basis before the independent
registered public accounting firm is engaged to provide each service. The pre-approval of services may be delegated to one or more of the audit committee&#146;s members, but the decision must be reported to the full audit committee at its next

maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP&#146;s status as an independent registered public accounting firm. All services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in 2016 and 2015 were pre-approved by our board of directors or the audit committee after
review of each of the services proposed for approval. </P>

quality of our financial reporting and such other matters as are required to be discussed under generally accepted accounting standards in the United States. The audit committee has also received from, and discussed with, our independent registered
public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No.&nbsp;16, &#147;Communications with Audit Committees&#148; issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). </P>

matters in the written disclosures and the letter regarding independence from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB. The audit committee has also considered the compatibility of audit related and tax services
with the auditors&#146; independence. Based on its evaluation, the audit committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2017. </P>
