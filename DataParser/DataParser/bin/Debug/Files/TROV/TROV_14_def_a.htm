the Board recommends on each of the enumerated proposals, with regard to any other matters that may be properly presented at the Annual Meeting and on all matters incident to the conduct of the Annual Meeting. If you are a registered stockholder and
attend the Annual Meeting, you may deliver your completed proxy card in person. If you are a street name stockholder and wish to vote at the Annual Meeting, you will need to obtain a proxy form from the institution that holds your shares. All votes
will be tabulated by the inspector of elections appointed for the Annual Meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To carry on business at the Annual Meeting, we must have a quorum. A quorum is present when a majority of the shares entitled to vote, as of
the Record Date, are represented in person or by proxy. Thus, 15,486,501 shares must be represented in person or by proxy to have a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one
is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or other nominee) or if you vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement. Shares owned by us are not considered outstanding or
considered to be present at the Annual Meeting. If there is not a quorum at the Annual Meeting, either the chairperson of the Annual Meeting or our stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting may adjourn the Annual Meeting. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>How Will my Shares be Voted if I Give No Specific Instruction? </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We must vote your shares as you have instructed. If there is a matter on which a stockholder of record has given no specific instruction but
has authorized us generally to vote the shares, they will be voted as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1. &#147;For&#148; the election of each of the seven

for example, if a stockholder of record merely signs, dates and returns the proxy card but does not indicate how its shares are to be voted on one or more proposals. If other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting and you do not provide
specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted at the discretion of the proxies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If your shares are held in street name, see

counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting, who will separately count, for the election of directors, &#147;For,&#148; &#147;Withhold&#148; and broker non-votes; and, with respect to the other proposals, votes
&#147;For&#148; and &#147;Against,&#148; abstentions and broker non-votes. Broker non-votes will not be included in the tabulation of the voting results of any of the proposals and, therefore, will have no effect on such proposals. </P>

shares are held in street name, you must instruct the organization who holds your shares how to vote your shares. If you sign your proxy card but do not provide instructions on how your broker should vote on &#147;routine&#148; proposals, your
broker will vote your shares as recommended by the Board. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any &#147;non-routine&#148; proposals. This vote is called a &#147;broker non-vote.&#148; Because broker non-votes
are not considered under Delaware law to be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, broker non-votes will not be included in the tabulation of the voting results of any of the proposals and, therefore, will have no effect on these proposals. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Brokers cannot use discretionary authority to vote shares on the election of directors if they have not received instructions from their

In addition to the solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited by our officers and other employees by telephone or in person. Such persons will receive no compensation for their services other than their regular salaries. Arrangements will also
be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of the shares held of record by such persons, and we may reimburse such persons for reasonable out of pocket

inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials. Although the Board will consider stockholder proposals, we reserve the right to omit from our proxy statement, or to vote against, stockholder proposals that we are not

leadership. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As Chairman, Dr.&nbsp;Adams serves as the primary liaison between the CEO and the independent directors and provides
strategic input and counseling to the CEO. With input from other members of the Board, committee chairs and management, he presides over meetings of the Board. Dr.&nbsp;Adams has developed an extensive knowledge of our company, its challenges and
opportunities and has a productive working relationship with our senior management team. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board, as a unified body and through
committee participation, organizes the execution of its monitoring and oversight roles and does not expect the Chairman to organize those functions. Our primary rationale for separating the positions of Chairman and CEO is the recognition of the
time commitments and activities required to function effectively as the Chairman and as the CEO of a company with a relatively flat management structure. The separation of roles has also permitted the Board to recruit senior executives into the CEO
position with skills and experience that meet the Board&#146;s planning for the position, some of which such individuals may not have extensive public company board experience. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board has three standing committees&#151;Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance/Nominating. The membership of each of the committees
of the Board is comprised of independent directors, with each of the committees having a separate chairman, each of whom is an independent director. Our non-management members of the Board meet in executive session at each regular Board meeting.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Risk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. Management is
responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks we face, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the Board has responsibility for satisfying
itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board
believes that establishing the right &#147;tone at the top&#148; and that full and open communication between executive management and the Board are essential for effective risk management and oversight. Our CEO communicates frequently with members
of the Board to discuss strategy and challenges facing our company. Senior management usually attends our regular quarterly Board meetings and is available to address any questions or concerns raised by the Board on risk management-related and any
other matters. Each quarter, the Board receives presentations from senior management on matters involving our key areas of operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board adopted the&nbsp;2014 Plan in June&nbsp;2014 and the&nbsp;2014 Plan was approved by our stockholders at our&nbsp;2014 Annual
Meeting. The Board initially authorized the issuance of up to&nbsp;2,500,000 shares of common stock under the&nbsp;2014 Plan, on June&nbsp;10, 2015 at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of
shares authorized under the 2014 Plan to 5,000,000 shares and on May&nbsp;17, 2016 at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares authorized under the 2014 Plan to 7,500,000 shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;21, 2017, the Board approved an amendment to the 2014 Plan, subject to approval by our stockholders. The Board amended the 2014
Plan to provide for, and submits to our stockholders for approval, an increase in the number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2014 Plan by 2,000,000 shares. The additional shares will increase the total shares of common stock
reserved for issuance under the 2007 Plan to an aggregate of 9,500,000 shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of April&nbsp;24, 2017, excluding the requested share
increase, there were&nbsp;1,835,101 shares of common stock available for issuance under the&nbsp;2014 Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Reasons for the Proposed Amendment
</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As described above, we are seeking stockholder approval of an amendment to increase the number of shares issuable pursuant to
the&nbsp;2014 Plan by 2,000,000 shares. In determining the amount of the increase contemplated by the proposed amendment to the&nbsp;2014 Plan, the Board has taken into consideration the fact that, excluding the requested share increase, as of
April&nbsp;24, 2017, there were approximately&nbsp;44,738,679 shares of our common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, and the Board believes that this fully-diluted number, rather than the number of outstanding shares of the Company, is the
relevant number in determining the appropriate number of shares available under the&nbsp;2014 Plan. Assuming the approval of this increase, the total number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the&nbsp;2014 Plan will
be&nbsp;3,835,101, which represents approximately&nbsp;8.6% of our common stock as calculated on a fully-diluted basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The purpose of
this increase is to continue to be able to attract, retain and motivate executive officers and other employees, non-employee directors and certain consultants. Upon stockholder approval of the amendment, additional shares of common stock will be
reserved for issuance under the&nbsp;2014 Plan, which will enable us to continue to grant equity awards to our officers, employees, consultants and non-employee directors at levels determined by the Board to be necessary to attract, retain and
motivate the individuals who will be critical to our success in achieving its business objectives and thereby creating greater value for all our stockholders. Furthermore, we believe that equity compensation aligns the interests of our management
and other employees with the interests of our other stockholders. Equity awards are a key component of our incentive compensation program. We believe that option grants have been critical in attracting and retaining talented employees and officers,
aligning their interests with those of stockholders, and focusing key employees on our long-term growth. We anticipate that option grants and other forms of equity awards such as restricted stock awards may become an increasing component in
similarly motivating our consultants. We have been growing very rapidly and we have exceeded our internal growth projections. In order to attract and retain qualified employees, we have had to grant stock options in excess of our historical equity
burn rate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Approval of the amendment to the&nbsp;2014 Plan will permit us to continue to use stock-based compensation to align
stockholder and employee interests and to motivate employees and others providing services to us or any subsidiary. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The terms of

us to change our current equity grant practices. If the adoption of the amendment to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under the&nbsp;2014 Plan is approved, the share reserve under the&nbsp;2014 Plan could last for a longer or
shorter period of time, depending on our future equity grant practices, which we cannot predict with any degree of certainty at this time. </TD></TR></TABLE>

unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. In particular, the forecasts set forth above in this Proposal&nbsp;3 include embedded assumptions regarding option exercise, employee turnover and competitive grant guidelines which are
highly dependent on the public trading price of our common stock and other factors, which we do not control, and, as a result, we do not as a matter of practice provide forecasts. In evaluating these forecasts, our Compensation Committee recognized
the high variability inherent in these assumptions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">However, we have included above a summary of these forecasts to give our stockholders

were reasonable at the time the forecasts were prepared and other factors such as industry performance and general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions, as well as factors specific to our business, all of which are
difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of our management. In addition, the utilization forecasts with respect to our equity awards do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were
prepared and, accordingly, do not give effect to any changes to our operations or strategy that may be implemented in the future. Accordingly, actual outcomes may be, and likely will be, materially different than those reflected in the forecasts. We

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following summary of the federal income tax consequences of the&nbsp;2014 Plan transactions is based upon federal income tax laws in effect
as of April&nbsp;24, 2017. This summary does not purport to be complete, and does not discuss state, local or non-U.S.&nbsp;tax consequences. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Nonqualified Stock Options.</I></B> The grant of a nonqualified stock option under the&nbsp;2014 Plan will not result in any federal
income tax consequences to the participant or to the Company. Upon exercise of a nonqualified stock option, the participant will recognize ordinary compensation income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares of Common stock at the
time of exercise over the option exercise price. If the participant is an employee, this income is subject to withholding for federal income and employment tax purposes. The Company is entitled to an income tax deduction in the amount of the income
recognized by the participant, subject to possible limitations imposed by the Code, including Section&nbsp;162(m) thereof. Any gain or loss on the participant&#146;s subsequent disposition of the shares will be treated as long-term or short-term
capital gain or loss, depending on the sales proceeds received and whether the shares are held for more than one year following exercise. The Company does not receive a tax deduction for any subsequent capital gain. <B><I> </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Incentive Options.</I></B> The grant of an ISO under the&nbsp;2014 Plan will not result in any federal income tax consequences to the
participant or to the Company. A participant recognizes no federal taxable income upon exercising an ISO (subject to the alternative minimum tax rules discussed below), and the Company receives no deduction at the time of exercise. In the event of a
disposition of stock acquired upon exercise of an ISO, the tax consequences depend upon how long the participant has held the shares. If the participant does not dispose of the shares within two years after the ISO was granted, nor within one year
after the ISO was exercised, the participant will recognize a long-term capital gain (or loss) equal to the difference between the sale price of the shares and the exercise price. The Company is not entitled to any deduction under these

on the disposition and the exercise price or (ii)&nbsp;the difference between the fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise and the exercise price. Such amount is not subject to withholding for federal income and employment tax
purposes, even if the participant is an employee of the Company. Any gain in excess of the amount taxed as ordinary income will generally be treated as a short-term capital gain. The Company, in the year of the disqualifying disposition, is entitled
to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary compensation income recognized by the participant, subject to possible limitations imposed by the Code, including Section&nbsp;162(m) thereof. </P>

stock is generally taxable to the participant as ordinary compensation income on the date that the restrictions lapse (i.e. the date that the stock vests), in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on such date over the
amount paid for such stock (if any). If the participant is an employee, this income is subject to withholding for federal income and employment tax purposes. The Company is entitled to an income tax deduction in the amount of the ordinary income
recognized by the participant, subject to possible limitations imposed by the Code, including Section&nbsp;162(m) thereof. Any gain or loss on the participant&#146;s subsequent disposition of the shares will be treated as long-term or short-term
capital gain or loss treatment depending on the sales price and how long the stock has been held since the restrictions lapsed. The Company does not receive a tax deduction for any subsequent gain. <B><I> </I></B></P>

Election&#148;) to recognize as ordinary compensation income in the year that such restricted stock is granted, the amount equal to the excess of the fair market value on the date of the issuance of the stock over the amount paid for such stock. If
such an election is made, the recipient recognizes no further amounts of compensation income upon the lapse of any restrictions and any gain or loss on subsequent disposition will be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss to the recipient. The
Section&nbsp;83(b) Election must be made within&nbsp;30&nbsp;days from the time the restricted stock is issued. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Other
Awards.</I></B> Other awards (such as restricted stock units) are generally treated as ordinary compensation income as and when common stock or cash are paid to the participant upon vesting or settlement of such awards. If the participant is an
employee, this income is subject to withholding for income and employment tax purposes. The Company is generally entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the recipient, subject to possible limitations

Code.</I></B> Under Code Section&nbsp;162(m), no deduction is allowed in any taxable year of the Company for compensation in excess of $1&nbsp;million paid to the Company&#146;s &#147;covered employees.&#148; A &#147;covered employee&#148; is the
Company&#146;s chief executive officer and the next three most highly compensated executive officers of the Company other than the chief financial officer. An exception to this rule applies to &#147;qualified performance based compensation,&#148;
which generally includes stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under a stockholder approved plan, and other forms of equity incentives, the vesting or payment of which is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain stockholder approved
performance goals. The Company intends that the&nbsp;2014 Plan allow for the grant of options and stock appreciation rights that may be treated as &#147;qualified performance based compensation&#148; that is exempt from the limitations of Code
Section&nbsp;162(m), and for the grant of other performance-based awards that may be treated as &#147;qualified performance based compensation,&#148; but it makes no assurance that either such type of award will be so treated. <B><I> </I></B></P>

imposes a limit on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any one year with respect to our chief executive officer and each of our next three most highly compensated executive officers, excluding the chief financial officer, unless certain
specific and detailed criteria are satisfied. Performance-based compensation, as defined in the Code, is fully deductible if the programs are approved by stockholders and meet other requirements. In general, we have determined that we will not seek
to limit executive compensation so that it is deductible under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. However, from time to time, we monitor whether it might be in our interests to structure our compensation programs to satisfy the requirements of
Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. We seek to maintain flexibility in compensating our executives in a manner designed to promote our corporate goals and, therefore, our Compensation Committee has not adopted a policy requiring that any or all

price increases over time. We believe that these variable elements of compensation are a sufficient percentage of overall compensation to motivate executives to produce superior short- and long-term corporate results, while the fixed element is also
sufficiently high that the executives are not encouraged to take unnecessary or excessive risks in doing so. </TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

than 5% of any class of our voting securities, any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons or any entity which is owned or controlled by any of the foregoing persons, or any entity in which one of the foregoing persons has a

services are not considered related-person transactions under this policy. Under our Audit Committee Charter and our related party transaction policy, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving in advance any related party
transaction. In connection with its review of a related party transaction, the Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally
available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party&#146;s interest in the related party transaction. </P>

Notice or other Annual Meeting materials addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as householding, potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. Stockholders who

account holders who are our stockholders will be &#147;householding&#148; our proxy materials. A Notice or proxy materials will be delivered in one single envelope to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been
received from one or more of the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding communications to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke
your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate Notice or proxy materials, please notify your broker or call our Secretary at (858)&nbsp;952-7570, or submit a request in writing
to our Secretary, c/o Trovagene, Inc., 11055 Flintkote Avenue, San Diego, California&nbsp;92121. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Notice or proxy materials at their address and would like to request householding of their
