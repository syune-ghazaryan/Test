Meeting, we must have a quorum. A quorum is present when a majority of the shares entitled to vote, as of the record date, are represented in person or by proxy. As of the record date, 2,130,206 shares of our common stock must be represented in
person or by proxy to have a quorum. Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker) or if you vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes
will be counted towards the quorum requirement. If there is not a quorum at the Annual Meeting, our stockholders may adjourn the meeting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Who pays
for this solicitation?</I></B> The expense of preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement and the accompanying material will be borne by the Company. Solicitation of individual stockholders may be made by mail, personal interviews,
telephone, facsimile, electronic delivery or other telecommunications by directors, officers and regular employees of the company who will receive no additional compensation for those activities. We have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. at an
estimated cost of $8,500 plus reimbursement of expenses to assist in our solicitation of proxies. Upon request, we will also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>What happens when two stockholders share the same address?</I></B> We may satisfy the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) rules
regarding delivery of proxy statements by delivering a single proxy statement to an address shared by two or more of our stockholders. This delivery method is known as &#147;householding&#148; and can result in meaningful cost savings for us. To
take advantage of this opportunity, we may deliver only one proxy statement to multiple stockholders who share an address, unless contrary instructions are received prior to the mailing date. Similarly, if you share an address with another
stockholder and have received multiple copies of our proxy materials, you may write us at the address above or call us at (650)&nbsp;871-0761 to request delivery of a single copy of these materials in the future. We undertake to deliver promptly
upon written or oral request a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of these documents was delivered. If you hold stock as a record stockholder and prefer to receive separate copies of a
proxy statement either now or in the future, please contact us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>What happens if other business not discussed in this proxy statement comes before

Board routinely receives at its meetings business updates from various members of management. These updates may identify matters that have emerged within that member of management&#146;s scope of responsibility that involve operational, financial,

above, the Audit Committee is responsible for discussing our exposure to material risks and the adequacy of our risk management activities with management and our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee&#146;s primary
emphasis is financial risk, including our internal control over financial reporting, and it reviews information received from our independent registered public accounting firm as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
and from other third parties in support of management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also oversees our management of exposure to certain financial risks through its
periodic review of our investment policy and the allocation of our investment portfolio. Beyond the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee is responsible for considering whether our compensation programs and practices are reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="toc370403_11"></A>Contacting the Board of Directors </B></P>

qualify as independent to serve on the Compensation Committee, the NASDAQ rules require a director not to accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the Company, other than for service on the Board, and that the Board consider
whether a director is affiliated with Catalyst and, if so, whether such affiliation would impair the director&#146;s judgment as a member of the Compensation Committee. The Board has concluded that the composition of the Compensation Committee meets
the requirements for independence under the rules and regulations of NASDAQ and of the SEC. In addition, the Compensation Committee, from time to time, retains independent compensation consultants to assist it with assessing the competitiveness of
executive and Board compensation. In April 2017, the Compensation Committee retained Radford, an Aon Hewitt company (&#147;Radford&#148;) as an independent compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee determined, based on its review of all
relevant factors, including those set forth in Rule 10C-1b(4)(i) through (iv)&nbsp;under the Exchange Act, that the work of Radford has not created any conflict of interest. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2017, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved an amendment and restatement of the Catalyst Biosciences,
Inc. 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated effective June&nbsp;9, 2016), which we refer to as the &#147;2015 Plan,&#148; subject to stockholder approval at the 2017 Annual Meeting (the &#147;Restatement&#148;). The Board recommends that
our stockholders approve the Restatement. The purpose of the Restatement, which is described in more detail below, is to (i)&nbsp;increase the authorized shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan by 950,000 shares, (ii)&nbsp;increase the
162(m) annual grant limits, and (iii)&nbsp;revise the non-employee director limit so that it applies to both equity awards and cash fees and is set at a fixed dollar value of $500,000. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2015 Plan was adopted upon approval by our stockholders on August&nbsp;18, 2015, and subsequently amended on December&nbsp;14, 2015 and
June&nbsp;9, 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are seeking stockholder approval of the Restatement in order to comply with NASDAQ rules requiring stockholder
approval of material amendments to equity compensation plans and the stockholder approval rules under Sections 162(m) and 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If approved by our stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting, the Restatement will become effective on June&nbsp;15, 2017. If the Restatement is
not approved by our stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting, then the 2015&nbsp;Plan will remain in effect with any shares previously authorized under the 2015 Plan remaining available for future awards under the 2015 Plan. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;10, 2017, we implemented a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock (the &#147;2017 Reverse
Stock Split&#148;). The 2017 Reverse Stock Split decreased our issued and outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 13.0&nbsp;million shares of common stock to approximately 868,000 shares as of that date. Unless otherwise indicated, all
historical share numbers, share prices and exercise prices included herein give effect to adjustments made for the 2017 Reverse Stock Split, as applicable, and all references to &#147;common stock,&#148; &#147;stock&#148; or &#147;shares&#148; means
shares of the Company&#146;s common stock as so adjusted. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Reasons to Approve the Amended 2015 Plan </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of April&nbsp;30, 2017, there were 125,289 shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the 2015 Plan, and 101,338 shares of
common stock available for issuance pursuant to future awards. If the Restatement is approved by our stockholders, an additional 950,000 shares will be authorized for issuance under the 2015 Plan, which would provide us with approximately 1,051,338
shares (based on the proposed 950,000 increase plus the number of shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan as of April&nbsp;30, 2017), plus the number of shares subject to any outstanding stock awards previously granted under the 2015 Plan or
our predecessor stock option plan that expire or terminate prior to issuance and would otherwise be returned to the share reserve under the 2015 Plan (not to exceed 1,056,117 shares). We anticipate the proposed 950,000 increase will provide the
Company with a pool of shares we expect will last for approximately two (2)&nbsp;years. Based on our total shares outstanding, plus warrants to purchase 2,041,225 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $5.50 per share issued in our April
2017 financing, warrants to purchase 12,039 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $145.11, 1,150,000 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock sold in our April 2017
financing at an effective conversion price of $5.00 per share, and 91,341 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding redeemable convertible notes at a conversion price of $137.85 per share, we anticipate a burn rate of
approximately 1,051,338 options in the aggregate over two years following the Annual Meeting. The final determination of the number of options granted under the Plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee and the burn rate may be greater
or less than this amount. We believe this estimated burn rate is reasonable and necessary to provide a predictable </P>

highly qualified employees and other service providers, and that the proposed 950,000 increase in shares under the 2015 Plan is necessary to ensure that we maintain the ability to continue attracting, retaining and incentivizing highly qualified
employees and other service providers in the future. We believe that the number of shares of common stock currently available under the 2015 Plan is insufficient to meet our current and future equity needs. Our employees and non-employee directors
receive equity awards as a component of their compensation and we intend to continue to grant equity awards to induce and incentive new and existing employees and non-employee directors. Due to the limited number of shares available for grant under
the 2015 Plan, equity awards granted to our currently serving Named Executive Officers in 2016 were limited to director awards and new hires and no equity awards were granted to our currently serving named executive officers in&nbsp;2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Management recruitment and retention is a key to our future success and will require the use of equity awards. Equity incentives are an
important component of our compensation philosophy, intended to provide equity ownership opportunities and performance-based incentives to better align the recipient&#146;s interests with those of our stockholders. We expect to need to continue to
add employees to further capitalize on the Company&#146;s success, expand its indications, and develop and launch new&nbsp;products. </P>

contractors of the Company and its affiliates to acquire or increase their holdings of the Company&#146;s common stock and other equity-based interests in the Company and/or to provide other incentive awards in order to promote a closer
identification of their interests with those of the Company and its stockholders, and to provide flexibility to the Company in its ability to motivate, attract and retain the services of participants upon whose judgment, interest and special effort
the successful conduct of its operation largely depends. If approved by our stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting, the 2015 Plan, as amended and restated will be effective June&nbsp;15, 2017, and awards can be granted under the 2015 Plan until
April&nbsp;15, 2026, or the Plan&#146;s earlier termination by the Board. Awards may be granted to selected employees, directors and independent contractors of the Company or its affiliates in the discretion of the Administrator (as defined below
under &#147;Administration; Amendment and Termination&#148;). As of April&nbsp;24, 2017, approximately ten (10)&nbsp;employees, five (5)&nbsp;non-employee directors and two&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;independent contractors were eligible to be selected to

types of awards authorized under the 2015 Plan include: options in the form of incentive options and/or nonqualified options; SARs in the form of freestanding SARs and/or related SARs; restricted awards in the form of restricted stock awards and/or
restricted stock units; performance awards in the form of performance shares and/or performance units; phantom stock awards; other stock-based awards; cash bonus awards; and/or dividend equivalent awards. The Company discusses the material terms of

practice, the Compensation Committee will administer the 2015 Plan, following delegation and subject to oversight by the Board. Unless the Board determines otherwise, the Board has sole authority to grant awards to non-employee directors. Each
member of the Compensation Committee is intended to be independent under applicable Code Section&nbsp;162(m), SEC Rule 16b-3 and NASDAQ listing standards. The Board and the Compensation Committee are referred to in this discussion collectively as

participant without the participant&#146;s consent. In addition, stockholder approval is required to amend the terms of outstanding options or SARs to reduce the option price or base price of such outstanding options or SARs; exchange outstanding
options or SARs for cash, for options or SARs with an option price or base price that is less than the option price or base price of the original option or SAR, or for other equity awards at a time when the original option or SAR has an option price

for shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, although incentive options may only be granted to the Company&#146;s employees. The Administrator will determine the option price at which a participant may exercise an option. The option price must be
no less than 100% of the fair market value per share of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant, or 110% of the fair market value with respect to incentive options granted to an employee who owns stock representing more than 10% of the
total combined voting power of all classes of the Company&#146;s stock or stock of its parent or subsidiary corporation, if any (except for certain options assumed or substituted in a merger or other transaction where the option price is adjusted in
accordance with applicable tax regulations). Unless an individual award agreement provides otherwise, the option price may be paid in the form of cash or cash equivalent; in addition, except where prohibited by the Administrator or applicable laws,
rules and regulations, payment may also be made by: (a)&nbsp;delivery of shares of common stock owned by the participant; (b)&nbsp;shares of common stock withheld upon exercise; (c)&nbsp;delivery of written notice of exercise to the Company and
delivery to a broker of written notice of exercise and irrevocable instructions to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the option price; (d)&nbsp;such other payment methods as may be approved by the
Administrator and which are acceptable under applicable law; or (e)&nbsp;any combination of these methods. The Administrator will determine the term and conditions of an option and the period or periods during which, and conditions pursuant to
which, a participant may exercise an option. The option term may not exceed 10 years, or five years with respect to incentive options granted to an employee who possesses more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of the
Company&#146;s stock or stock of its parent or subsidiary corporation, if any. Options are generally subject to certain restrictions on exercise if the participant terminates employment or service unless an award agreement provides otherwise. </P>

which the SAR is being exercised, consideration equal in value to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise over the base price per share of
such SAR. The base price may be no less than the fair market value per share of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date the SAR is granted (except for certain SARs assumed or substituted in a merger or other transaction where the base price is

canceled to the extent of the number of shares as to which a related option is exercised or surrendered. An SAR may not be exercised more than 10 years after it was granted, or such shorter period as may apply to related options in the case of
related SARs. The Administrator will determine the extent, if any, to which a participant may exercise an SAR following termination of employment or service, which rights, if any, will be stated in an award agreement. </P>

described above, the Chief Executive Officer and the three highest compensated Named Executive Officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer) that may be exempt from Code Section&nbsp;162(m). The Compensation
Committee has the discretion to grant performance awards that are not intended to satisfy the requirements for &#147;performance-based&#148; compensation under Code Section&nbsp;162(m). Code Section&nbsp;162(m) generally prohibits a public
corporation from deducting more than $1,000,000 a year for compensation paid to each of the covered employees of the corporation unless the compensation qualifies as performance-based compensation. In order to qualify as performance-based
compensation, the compensation must be contingent on achieving pre-established objective performance goals determined and certified by a committee comprised of outside directors. All of the members of the Company&#146;s Compensation Committee, which
will have the discretion to grant performance awards to covered employees, are outside directors under Code Section&nbsp;162(m) standards. </P>

granted under the 2015 Plan as of the date of this proxy statement. The summary is general in nature and is not intended to cover all tax consequences that may apply to a particular employee or to the Company. The provisions of the Code and related

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I><U>Incentive Options</U></I>. Incentive options granted under the 2015 Plan are intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Code
Section&nbsp;422. Pursuant to Code Section&nbsp;422, the grant and exercise of an incentive stock option generally will not result in taxable income to the participant (with the possible exception of alternative minimum tax liability) if the
participant does not dispose of shares received upon exercise of such option less than one year after the date of exercise and two years after the date of grant, and if the participant has continuously been the Company&#146;s employee from the date
of grant to three months before the date of exercise (or 12 months in the event of death or disability). However, the excess of the fair market value of the shares received upon exercise of the incentive option over the option price for such shares
generally will constitute an item of adjustment in computing the participant&#146;s alternative minimum taxable income for the year of exercise. Thus, certain participants may increase their federal income tax liability as a result of the exercise
of an incentive option under the alternative minimum tax rules of the Code. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company generally will not be entitled to a deduction for
income tax purposes in connection with the exercise of an incentive option. Upon the disposition of shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive option, the participant will be taxed on the amount by which the amount realized upon such disposition
exceeds the option price, and such amount will be treated as capital gain or loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the holding period requirements for incentive
option treatment described above are not met, the participant will be taxed as if he or she received compensation in the year of the disposition. The participant must treat gain realized in the premature disposition as ordinary income to the extent
of the lesser of: (a)&nbsp;the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise minus the option price or (b)&nbsp;the amount realized on disposition of the stock minus the option price. Any gain in excess of these amounts may be treated as
capital gain. The Company generally will be entitled to a corresponding income tax deduction to the extent that the amount represents reasonable compensation and an ordinary and necessary business expense, subject to any required income tax
reporting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Code and the terms of the 2015 Plan, in no event can there first become exercisable by a participant in any
one calendar year incentive options granted by the Company with respect to shares having an aggregate fair market value (determined at the time an option is granted) greater than $100,000. To the extent an incentive option granted under the 2015
Plan exceeds this limitation, it will be treated as a nonqualified option. In addition, no incentive option may be granted to an individual who owns, immediately before the time that the option is granted, stock possessing more than 10% of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, unless the option price is equal to or exceeds 110% of the fair market value of the stock and the option period does not exceed five years. </P>

such date and any cash amount awarded, less cash or other consideration paid (if any), will be included in the participant&#146;s ordinary income as compensation, except that, in the case of restricted stock issued at the beginning of the

Administrator with respect to the Plan may be taken by a written instrument signed by all of the members of the Board or Committee, as appropriate, and any such action so taken by written consent shall be as fully effective as if it had been taken
by a majority of the members at a meeting duly held and called. All determinations of the Administrator with respect to the Plan and any Award or Award Agreement will be final and binding on the Company and all persons having or claiming an interest
in any Award granted under the Plan. No member of the Board or Committee, as applicable, shall be liable while acting as Administrator for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan, an Award or an Award Agreement. The
