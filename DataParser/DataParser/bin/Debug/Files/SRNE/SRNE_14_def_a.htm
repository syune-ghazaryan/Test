Shares owned by us are not considered outstanding or considered to be present at the Annual Meeting. If there is not a quorum at the Annual Meeting, the chairperson of the Annual Meeting may adjourn the Annual Meeting. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If your shares are held in street name, you must instruct the organization who holds your shares how to vote your shares. If you sign your proxy card but do
not provide instructions on how your broker should vote on &#147;routine&#148; proposals (discussed in the next question), your broker will vote your shares as recommended by the Board. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not
be voted on any &#147;non-routine&#148; proposals. This vote is called a &#147;broker non-vote.&#148; Because broker non-votes are not considered under Delaware law to be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, broker non-votes will not be included
in the tabulation of the voting results of any of the proposals and, therefore, will have no effect on these proposals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Brokers cannot use discretionary

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An abstention is a stockholder&#146;s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. Our Bylaws provide that an action of our stockholders (other than
the election of directors) is approved if a majority of the votes cast are in favor of such action. Under Delaware law (under which Sorrento is incorporated), abstentions are counted as shares present and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, but
they are not counted as shares cast. Therefore, abstentions will have no effect on Proposal&nbsp;2, the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending
December&nbsp;31, 2017 or Proposal&nbsp;3, the approval of an amendment to the&nbsp;2009 Plan to (i)&nbsp;increase the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the&nbsp;2009 Plan by&nbsp;5,000,000 shares from&nbsp;6,260,000 shares

person at the Annual Meeting. All written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to revocations of proxies should be addressed to: Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., 4955&nbsp;Directors Place, San Diego, California&nbsp;92121,

material will be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, dealers, voting trustees, their respective nominees and other agents holding shares in their names, which are beneficially owned by others, so that they may forward such solicitation material,
together with our Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, as amended, to beneficial owners. In addition, if asked, we will reimburse these persons for their reasonable expenses in forwarding these materials

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Board has the responsibility for establishing corporate policies and for our overall performance, although it is not involved in our day-to-day operations.
Our Board consults with our counsel to ensure that our Board&#146;s determinations are consistent with all relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the definition of &#147;independent,&#148; including those set forth in the rules
of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (the &#147;NASDAQ Rules&#148;), as in effect from time to time. Consistent with these considerations, after review of all relevant transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his or her family
members, us, our senior management and our independent registered public accounting firm, our Board has determined that all of our directors, other than Dr.&nbsp;Ji and Mr.&nbsp;Shah, are independent. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently have a separate Chairman of the Board, Mr.&nbsp;Marth, and Chief Executive Officer, Dr.&nbsp;Ji. We believe that having an independent director
serve as our Chairman allows our Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;) to focus on our business, while allowing the Chairman to fulfill his fundamental Board leadership role, which includes providing advice to and independent oversight of our
Board. As Chairman, Mr.&nbsp;Marth serves as the primary liaison between the CEO and the independent directors and provides strategic input and counseling to the CEO. With input from other members of the Board, committee chairs and management, he
presides over meetings of the Board. Mr.&nbsp;Marth has developed an extensive knowledge of our company and its challenges and opportunities and has a productive working relationship with our senior management team. </P>

Chairman to organize those functions. The Board has three standing committees &#150; Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance and Nominating. The membership of each of the Board committees is comprised of independent directors, with each of the
committees having a separate chairman, each of whom is an independent director. Our non-management members of the Board meet in executive session, at which only they are present, at each board meeting. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Risk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success.
Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks the company faces, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the Board has the
responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Board recognizes that different leadership models may, depending upon individual circumstances, work for other companies and may be appropriate for the Company under different circumstances. The Board believes that the Company will greatly benefit
from having a single person setting the tone and direction for the Company and having primary responsibility for managing its operations, while allowing the Board to carry out its oversight responsibilities with the full involvement of each
independent director. Our CEO communicates frequently with members of the Board to discuss strategy and challenges facing the company. Senior management usually attends our regular quarterly board meetings and is available to address any questions
or concerns raised by the Board on risk management-related and any other matters. Each quarter, the Board receives presentations from senior management on matters involving our areas of operations. </P>

written charter of the Compensation Committee that is available to stockholders on our Internet website at www.sorrentotherapeutics.com/investors under &#147;Corporate Governance.&#148; The Compensation Committee meets periodically throughout the
year as necessary. The agenda for each meeting is usually developed by the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer and other representatives of senior management as necessary. The Compensation
Committee meets regularly in executive session. However, from time to time, various members of management and other employees as well as outside advisors or consultants may be invited by the Compensation Committee to make presentations, provide
financial or other background information or advice or otherwise participate in Compensation Committee meetings. The Chief Executive Officer may not participate in or be present during any deliberations or determinations of the Compensation
Committee regarding his compensation. The charter of the Compensation Committee grants the Compensation Committee full access to all of our books, records, facilities and personnel, as well as authority to obtain, at our expense, advice and
assistance from internal and external legal, accounting or other advisors and consultants and other external resources that the Compensation Committee considers necessary or appropriate in the performance of its duties. In particular, the
Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain or consult compensation consultants to assist in its evaluation of executive and director compensation, including the authority to approve the consultant&#146;s reasonable fees and other
retention terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Compensation Committee meets outside the presence of all of our executive officers, including the named executive officers, in order
to consider appropriate compensation for our Chief Executive Officer. For all other named executive officers, the Compensation Committee meets outside the presence of all executive officers except our Chief Executive Officer. The annual performance
reviews of our executive officers are considered by the Compensation Committee when making decisions on setting base salary, targets for and payments under our bonus plan and grants of equity incentive awards. When making decisions on executive
officers, the Compensation Committee considers the importance of the position to us, the past salary history of the executive officer and the contributions we expect the executive officer to make to the success of our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2016, the Compensation Committee engaged Frederic W. Cook&nbsp;&amp; Co., Inc. (&#147;FW Cook&#148;) as a compensation consultant. As part of its
engagement, the Compensation Committee requested that FW Cook develop a comparative group of companies and perform analyses of competitive performance and compensation levels for the comparative group. FW Cook, who reports directly to the
Compensation Committee and not to our management, is independent from us, has not provided any services to us other than to the Compensation Committee, and receives compensation from us only for services provided to the Compensation Committee. The
Compensation Committee assessed the independence of FW Cook pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that the work of FW Cook has not raised any conflict of interest. </P>

During&nbsp;2016, none of the aforementioned individuals was an officer or employee of ours, was formerly an officer of ours or had any relationship requiring disclosure by us under Item&nbsp;404 of Regulation&nbsp;S-K. No interlocking relationship
as described in Item&nbsp;407(e)(4) of Regulation&nbsp;S-K exists between any of our executive officers or Compensation Committee members, on the one hand, and the executive officers or compensation committee members of any other entity, on the
other hand, nor has any such interlocking relationship existed in the past. </P>

ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of different independent registered public accounting firm at

Company&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm. The reports of Mayer Hoffman on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 did not contain an adverse opinion or a
disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 and the subsequent interim period through September&nbsp;6, 2016, there
were no &#147;disagreements&#148; (as defined in Item&nbsp;304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation&nbsp;S-K and related instructions) with Mayer Hoffman on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Mayer Hoffman, would have caused Mayer Hoffman to make reference thereto in their reports on the consolidated financial statements for such fiscal years. During the fiscal years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 and any subsequent interim period through September&nbsp;6, 2016, there were no &#147;reportable events&#148; (as defined in Item&nbsp;304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). </P>

September&nbsp;7, 2016 (the &#147;Form 8-K&#148;) and requested that Mayer Hoffman furnish the Company with a copy of its letter addressed to the SEC, pursuant to Item&nbsp;304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K, stating whether or not Mayer Hoffman agrees
with the statements related to them made by the Company in the Form 8-K. A copy of Mayer Hoffman&#146;s letter to the SEC dated September&nbsp;6, 2016 is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to the Form 8-K. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Audit Committee has adopted a policy for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm.
The policy generally pre-approves specified services in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services and tax services up to specified amounts. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the Audit Committee&#146;s approval of the
scope of the engagement of the independent auditors or on an individual explicit case-by-case basis before the independent registered public accounting firm are engaged to provide each service. The pre-approval of services may be delegated to one or
more of the Audit Committee members, but the decision must be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. By the adoption of this policy, the Audit Committee has delegated the authority to pre-approve services to the
Chairperson of the Audit Committee, subject to certain limitations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Audit Committee has determined that the rendering of services by Deloitte other
than audit services is compatible with maintaining the principal accounting firm&#146;s independence. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Vote Required; Recommendation of the Board of

which a broker or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote. Accordingly, it is unlikely that any broker non-votes will result from this proposal. </P>

of the&nbsp;2009 Plan to, among other things, (a)&nbsp;increase the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the&nbsp;2009 Plan to&nbsp;1,360,000, (b)&nbsp;modify the evergreen provision so that the total number of shares of our common
stock reserved for issuance under the&nbsp;2009 Plan automatically increases at the beginning of each fiscal year by the lesser of (i)&nbsp;1% of the aggregate number of shares of our common stock outstanding on the last day of the immediately

fiscal year. The amendment and restatement was approved by our stockholders on April&nbsp;26, 2013. On April&nbsp;16, 2014, our Board adopted an amendment to the&nbsp;2009 Plan to remove the evergreen provision and to increase the number of shares
authorized under the 2009&nbsp;Plan to&nbsp;3,760,000 shares, which was approved by our stockholders at the&nbsp;2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June&nbsp;19, 2014. On May&nbsp;12, 2016, our Board approved an amendment to the 2009 Plan

is limited where necessary to meet requirements under Rule&nbsp;16b-3 under the Exchange Act or Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of&nbsp;1986 (the &#147;Code&#148;). Neither we nor the Administrator may reprice any stock option or

rights that it deems appropriate. A recipient&#146;s share appreciation rights agreement shall specify the terms upon which the recipient may exercise a share appreciation right in the event the recipient&#146;s relationship with us, or any of our

the shares; however, in no event shall Participants holding restricted shares be entitled to receive<I> </I>dividends, payments or other distributions paid with respect to restricted shares prior to the time the restricted shares are vested. Shares

other rights associated with stock ownership, unless otherwise provided in a participant&#146;s restricted share unit award agreement; however, in no event shall Participants holding restricted share units be entitled to receive dividends, payments
or other distributions paid with respect to shares underlying the restricted share units prior to the time the restricted share units are vested. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable restricted share unit award agreement, restricted share

Administrator. The Administrator will also determine whether performance awards are intended to be performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. Following is a brief discussion of the requirements for awards
to be treated as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code.<I> </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Performance-Based Compensation under

within the meaning of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code in order to preserve the deductibility of these awards for federal income tax purposes. Under the&nbsp;2009 Plan, these performance-based awards may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock
or a combination of cash and shares. Participants are entitled to receive payment for a Code Section&nbsp;162(m) performance-based award for any given performance period only to the extent that pre-established performance goals set by our

fashion the manner of calculating the performance criteria it selects to use for such awards. With regard to a particular performance period, the Compensation Committee will have the discretion to select the length of the performance period, the

items relating to financing activities; expenses for restructuring or productivity initiatives; other non-operating items; items related to acquisitions; items attributable to the business operations of any entity acquired by the Company during the
performance period; items related to the disposal of a business or segment of a business; items related to discontinued operations that do not qualify as a segment of a business under applicable accounting standards; items attributable to any stock
dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of stock occurring during the performance period; any other items of significant income or expense which are determined to be appropriate adjustments; items relating to unusual or extraordinary

with the general tax principles that apply and is provided only for general information. Some kinds of taxes, such as state, local and foreign income taxes and federal employment taxes, are not discussed. Tax laws are complex and subject to change
and may vary depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality. The summary does not discuss all aspects of income taxation that may be relevant in light of a holder&#146;s personal investment circumstances. This summarized tax
information is not tax advice. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Non-Qualified Stock Options</I></B><B>.</B> For federal income tax purposes, if an optionee is granted an
NSO under the 2009&nbsp;Plan, the optionee will not have taxable income on the grant of the option, nor will we be entitled to any deduction. Generally, upon exercise of NSOs the optionee will recognize ordinary income, and we will be entitled to a
deduction, in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of a common share over the option exercise price on the date each such option is exercised. The optionee&#146;s basis for the stock for purposes of determining gain or loss on
subsequent disposition of such shares generally will be the fair market value of the common stock on the date the optionee exercises such option. Any subsequent gain or loss will be generally taxable as capital gains or losses.<B><I> </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Incentive Stock Options</I></B><B>.</B> There is no taxable income to an optionee when an optionee is granted an ISO or when that option is exercised.
However, the amount by which the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise exceeds the option price will be an &#147;item of adjustment&#148; for the optionee for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. Gain realized by the optionee
on the sale of an ISO is taxable at capital gains rates, and no tax deduction is available to us, unless the optionee disposes of the shares within (a)&nbsp;two years after the date of grant of the option or (b)&nbsp;within one year of the date the
shares were transferred to the optionee. If the common shares are sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of the two-year and one-year periods specified above, the excess of the fair market value of a common share over the option exercise price
on the date of the option&#146;s exercise will be taxed at ordinary income rates (or, if less, the gain on the sale), and we will be entitled to a deduction to the extent the optionee must recognize ordinary income. If such a sale or disposition
takes place in the year in which the optionee exercises the option, the income the optionee recognizes upon sale or disposition of the shares will not be considered an item of adjustment for alternative minimum tax purposes.<B><I> </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An ISO exercised more than three months after an optionee terminates employment, for reasons other than death or disability, will be taxed as an NSO, and the
optionee will recognize ordinary income on the exercise. We will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the ordinary income, if any, realized by the optionee. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Restricted Stock</I></B><B>.</B> An individual to whom restricted stock is issued generally will not recognize taxable income upon such issuance, and we
generally will not then be entitled to a deduction, unless an election is made by the participant under Section&nbsp;83(b) of the Code. However, when restrictions on shares of restricted stock lapse, such that the shares are no longer subject to a
substantial risk of forfeiture, the individual generally will recognize ordinary income, and we generally will be entitled to a deduction for an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the date such restrictions lapse
over the purchase price. If a timely election is made under Section&nbsp;83(b) with respect to restricted stock, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income on the date of the issuance equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market
value of the shares at that date over the purchase price of such shares, and we will be entitled to a deduction for the same amount.<B><I> </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Share appreciation rights</I></B><B>.</B> A participant will not be taxed upon the grant of a share appreciation right. Upon the exercise of the share
appreciation right, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the amount of cash or the fair market value of the stock received upon exercise. At the time of exercise, we will be eligible for a tax deduction as a compensation expense
equal to the amount that the participant recognizes as ordinary income.<B><I> </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Other Stock Awards and Performance Bonus
Awards</I></B><B>.</B> The participant will have ordinary income upon receipt of stock or cash payable under performance awards, dividend equivalents, restricted share units and stock payments. We will be eligible for a tax deduction as a
compensation expense equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant.<B><I> </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code.
</I></B>In general, under Section&nbsp;162(m), income tax deductions of publicly-held corporations may be limited to the extent total compensation (including base salary, annual bonus, stock option exercises and non-qualified benefits paid) for
specified executive officers exceeds $1&nbsp;million (less the amount of any &#147;excess parachute payments&#148; as defined in Section&nbsp;280G of the Code) in any one year. However, under Section&nbsp;162(m), the deduction limit does not apply
to certain &#147;qualified performance-based compensation&#148; established by an independent Compensation Committee which conforms to certain conditions<B><I> </I></B>stated under the<B><I> </I></B></P>

</I></B>Code and related regulations. Options and share appreciation rights granted by the Compensation Committee under the&nbsp;2009 Plan are intended to qualify as &#147;qualified
performance-based compensation&#148; under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. The&nbsp;2009 Plan has been structured with the intent that certain other awards granted under the&nbsp;2009 Plan may, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, be
structured so as to qualify for the &#147;qualified performance-based compensation&#148; exception to the $1&nbsp;million annual deductibility limit of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. However, awards granted under the&nbsp;2009 Plan will be treated
as qualified performance-based compensation under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code only if the awards and the procedures associated with them comply with all requirements of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. There can be no assurance that compensation
attributable to awards granted under the&nbsp;2009 Plan will be treated as qualified performance-based compensation under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code and thus be deductible to us.<B><I> </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;409A Requirements</I></B><B>.</B> Certain awards under the&nbsp;2009 Plan may be considered &#147;nonqualified
deferred compensation&#148; for purposes of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code (&#147;Section&nbsp;409A&#148;), which imposes certain requirements on compensation that is deemed under Section&nbsp;409A to involve nonqualified deferred compensation. Among
other things, the requirements relate to the timing of elections to defer, the timing of distributions and prohibitions on the acceleration of distributions. Failure to comply with these requirements (or an exception from such requirements) may
result in the immediate taxation of all amounts deferred under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years, by or for any participant with respect to whom the failure relates, the imposition of an
additional&nbsp;20% income tax on the participant for the amounts required to be included in gross income and the possible imposition of penalty interest on the unpaid tax. Generally, Section&nbsp;409A does not apply to incentive awards that are
paid at the time the award vests. Likewise, Section&nbsp;409A typically does not apply to restricted stock. Section&nbsp;409A may, however, apply to incentive awards the payment of which is delayed beyond the calendar year in which the award vests.
Treasury regulations generally provide that the type of awards provided under the&nbsp;2009 Plan will not be considered nonqualified deferred compensation. However, to the extent that Section&nbsp;409A applies to an award issued under the&nbsp;2009
Plan, the&nbsp;2009 Plan and all such awards will, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance with Section&nbsp;409A. Under the&nbsp;2009 Plan, the Administrator has the discretion to grant or to unilaterally modify any award issued under
the&nbsp;2009 Plan in a manner that conforms with the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A with respect to deferred compensation or voids any participant election to the extent it would violate Section&nbsp;409A. The Administrator also has sole
discretion to interpret the requirements of the Code, including Section&nbsp;409A, for purposes of the&nbsp;2009 Plan and all awards issued under the&nbsp;2009 Plan.<B><I> </I></B></P>

with respect to executive compensation are to attract and retain talented and dedicated executives, to tie annual and long-term cash and stock incentives to achievement of specified performance objectives, and to create incentives resulting in
increased stockholder value. To achieve these goals, our Compensation Committee recommends to our Board executive compensation packages, generally comprising a mix of salary, discretionary bonus and equity awards. Although we have not adopted any
formal guidelines for allocating total compensation between equity compensation and cash compensation, we have implemented and maintain compensation plans that tie a substantial portion of our executives&#146; overall compensation to achievement of
corporate goals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Role of Compensation Consultant </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Compensation Committee has the power to engage independent advisors to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. In&nbsp;2016, the Compensation
Committee engaged FW Cook, a compensation consulting firm, to review and advise on our compensation practices. The Compensation Committee assessed the independence of FW Cook pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that the work of FW Cook has not
raised any conflict of interest. FW Cook prepared a report dated August&nbsp;2016 (the &#147;August&nbsp;2016 Report&#148;) that surveyed the compensation policies of our peer group, including compensation and benefits of our key employees, and
comparing the results of the survey with our existing compensation practices. The Compensation Committee used the August 2016 Report as one factor for determining the compensation of our named executive officers during&nbsp;2016 in order to ensure
that the compensation for our named executive officers was set at competitive levels. The Compensation Committee also relied on its members&#146; collective experience and expertise in determining the appropriate levels of compensation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to compensation determinations made in&nbsp;2016, our peer group consisted of the following companies, which were determined to:
(i)&nbsp;generally have similar revenues as us, (ii)&nbsp;generally have similar market capitalization as us, (iii)&nbsp;generally have the same operating income as us, and (iv)&nbsp;generally have the same number of employees as us: </P>

Compensation Committee reviewed the market data presented in the August 2016 Report and compared each named executive officer&#146;s base salary, target annual performance bonus and equity compensation value, separately and in the aggregate, to
amounts paid to similarly-situated executives at our peer companies. The Compensation Committee believes that targeting compensation towards similarly situated executives at our peer companies helps achieve the compensation objectives described
above. However, compensation for each executive may vary from this range depending on other factors the Compensation Committee considers relevant, such as internal pay equity amongst our named executive officers or levels of authority,
responsibility and experience of our named executive officers that exceed the norms for individuals holding comparably-titled positions at other companies. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on a review of the competitive market base pay data for chief operating officers included in our peer group in the August 2016 Report, effective
August&nbsp;12, 2016, the base salary of Dr.&nbsp;Su, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, was increased from $400,000 to $414,000 with retroactive effect to January&nbsp;1, 2016. </P>

with Dr.&nbsp;Ji, Dr.&nbsp;Ji&#146;s target annual bonus is equal to 55% of his annual salary. Our employment agreements with each of Mr.&nbsp;Ng and Dr.&nbsp;Su each provide that the applicable named executive officer&#146;s target annual bonus is
equal to 35% of his respective annual salary. Our former employment agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Herde provided that his target annual bonus was equal to 35% of his annual salary. Our offer letter with Dr.&nbsp;Zeldis provides that Dr.&nbsp;Zeldis&#146;
annual target bonus is equal to 40% of his annual salary. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of the date of this proxy statement, the Compensation Committee has not yet determined the
annual bonus amounts, if any, that will be awarded our named executive officers for 2016. Once such annual bonus amounts, if any, have been determined, we will, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, file a
Current Report on Form 8-K or otherwise disclose the 2016 annual bonus amounts within four business days after the Compensation Committee has assessed 2016 performance and determined the 2016 annual bonus awards for our named executive officers.

bonuses are intended to compensate our executive officers for short-term performance. We also have adopted an equity incentive program intended to reward longer-term performance and to help align the interests of our named executive officers with
those of our stockholders. We believe that long-term performance is achieved through an ownership culture that rewards performance by our named executive officers through the use of equity incentives. Our equity incentive plan has been established
to provide our employees, including our named executive officers, with incentives to help align those employees&#146; interests with the interests of our stockholders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When making equity-award decisions, the Compensation Committee considers market data, the grant size, the forms of long-term equity compensation available to
it under our existing plans and the status of previously granted awards. The amount of equity incentive compensation granted reflects the executives&#146; expected contributions to our future success. Existing ownership levels are not a factor in
award determination, as the Compensation Committee does not want to discourage executives from holding significant amounts of our stock. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Future equity awards that we make to our named executive officers will be driven by our sustained performance
over time, our named executive officers&#146; ability to impact our results that drive stockholder value, their level of responsibility, their potential to fill roles of increasing responsibility, and competitive equity award levels for similar
positions in comparable companies. Equity forms a key part of the overall compensation for each executive officer and is evaluated each year as part of the annual performance review process and incentive payout calculation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The amounts awarded to the named executive officers are based on the Compensation Committee&#146;s subjective determination of what is appropriate to
incentivize the executives. Generally, the grants to named executive officers vest over: (i)&nbsp;a four-year period with&nbsp;25% vesting on each anniversary of the grant date, or (ii)&nbsp;a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">four-year</FONT> period
with&nbsp;1/4 of the shares vesting on the first anniversary of the applicable vesting commencement date, and&nbsp;1/48 of the shares vesting thereafter on a monthly basis. All equity awards to our employees, including named executive officers, and
to directors, have been granted and reflected in our financial statements, based upon the applicable accounting guidance, with the exercise price equal to the fair market value of one share of common stock on the grant date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2016 and August&nbsp;2016, the Compensation Committee decided to grant long-term equity based incentives in the form of options to purchase shares of
common stock to our then current named executive officers. The Compensation Committee considered the August 2016 Report and other data in determining the number of options granted to our named executive officers in August 2016. It is our view that
option based awards best align with the interest of our stockholders. The equity awards granted to our named executive officers in&nbsp;2016 are set forth in the&nbsp;2016 Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards During Fiscal
Year&nbsp;2016 table contained herein. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to encourage a long-term perspective and to encourage key employees to remain with us, our stock options
typically have annual vesting over a four-year period and a term of ten years. Generally, vesting ends upon termination of services and exercise rights of vested options cease three months after termination of services. Prior to the exercise of an
option, the holder has no rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares subject to such option, including voting rights and the right to receive dividends or dividend equivalents. </P>

to be both affordable and competitive in relation to the market while conforming with local laws and practices. We monitor the market, local laws and practices and adjust our benefits programs as needed. We design our benefits programs to provide an
element of core benefits and, to the extent possible, offer options for additional benefits, be tax-effective for employees in each country and balance costs and cost sharing between us and our employees. </P>

Committee may approve stock option grants to our executive officers. Stock options are generally granted at meetings of the Compensation Committee. On limited occasions, a grant may be made pursuant to a unanimous written consent of the Compensation
Committee, which occurs primarily for the purpose of approving a compensation package for a newly hired or promoted executive. The exercise price of a newly granted option is the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. </P>

(&#147;Say-on-Pay Votes&#148;). In our most recent Say-On-Pay Vote, conducted at our 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, held on June&nbsp;4, 2015, our stockholders approved the compensation of our named executive officers on an advisory basis. We

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of&nbsp;1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), imposes a limit on the amount of compensation that we may
deduct in any one year with respect to our Chief Executive Officer and each of our next three most highly compensated executive officers, excluding the Chief Financial Officer, unless certain specific and detailed criteria are satisfied.
Performance-based compensation, as defined in the Code, is fully deductible if the programs are approved by stockholders and meet other requirements. In general, we have determined that, at this time, we will not seek to limit executive compensation
so that it is deductible under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. However, from time to time, we monitor whether it might be in our interests to structure our compensation programs to satisfy the requirements of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. We
seek to maintain flexibility in compensating our executives in a manner designed to promote our corporate goals and, therefore, our Compensation Committee has not adopted a policy requiring that any or all compensation to be deductible. Our
Compensation Committee will continue to assess the impact of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code on our compensation practices and determine what further action, if any, is appropriate. </P>

was set at $500,000. Effective August&nbsp;12, 2016, Dr.&nbsp;Ji&#146;s salary was increased to $550,000. On November&nbsp;11, 2016, the Company and Dr.&nbsp;Ji agreed to rescind 200,000 of the shares subject to an option to purchase 500,000 shares
of common stock granted to Dr.&nbsp;Ji on August&nbsp;12, 2016. In connection with the rescission of the 200,000 shares subject to the option, the Compensation Committee determined: (a)&nbsp;to increase Dr.&nbsp;Ji&#146;s salary to $600,000 with
retroactive effective to January&nbsp;1, 2016, and (b)&nbsp;to award Dr.&nbsp;Ji a one-time $200,000 cash bonus. Additionally, his target annual bonus is set at&nbsp;55% of his annual salary. </P>

subsidiaries (&#147;TNK&#148;), and Celularity, Inc. (&#147;Celularity&#148;), pursuant to which, among other things, we and TNK agreed to contribute certain intellectual property rights related to our proprietary chimeric antigen receptor
(&#147;CAR&#148;) constructs and related CARs to Celularity in exchange for shares of Celularity&#146;s Series A Preferred Stock equal to 25% of Celularity&#146;s outstanding shares of capital stock, calculated on a fully-diluted basis (the
&#147;Celularity Shares&#148;). The contribution will be made pursuant to a License and Transfer Agreement to be entered into by and among Sorrento, TNK and Celularity (the &#147;License Agreement&#148;). The obligations of us and TNK to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement are subject to, among other things, Celularity raising minimum financing through the sale of equity in one or more capital raising transactions, the closing of Celularity&#146;s acquisition
of certain third party assets and customary other closing conditions. The obligations of Celularity to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement are subject to, among other things, customary closing conditions. </P>

which they are or may be made a party or threatened to be made a party by reason of their position as a director, officer or other agent of ours, and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and our Bylaws. We also have an

the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding communications to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time,
you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate Notice or proxy materials, please notify your broker or call the Company&#146;s Secretary at (858)&nbsp;203-4100, or submit a request in writing to our

the matters addressed in Section&nbsp;10, the specific objectives, goals and performance criteria that further define the Performance Award. Each Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement signed by the Company and, if required by the Committee,
by the Participant. The Award Agreement shall set forth the material terms and conditions of the Award established by the Committee, and each Award shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Sections&nbsp;23, 24, and&nbsp;26 unless
otherwise specifically provided in an Award Agreement. All Awards granted pursuant to the Plan shall have a minimum vesting period of one year from the date of grant. </P>

without regard to the terms or conditions of such surrendered Award, and may contain any other terms that the Committee deems appropriate. In the case of Options, these other terms may not include an exercise price that is lower than the exercise
price of the surrendered Option unless the Company&#146;s stockholders approve the Option grant itself or the program under which the Option grant is made pursuant to the Plan. </P>

delivered to Participants. Each Option shall be designated in the Award Agreement as an ISO or a Non-ISO, and the same Award Agreement may grant both types of Options. At the sole discretion of the Committee, any Option may be exercisable, in whole
or in part, immediately upon the grant thereof, or only after the occurrence of a specified event, or only in installments, which installments may vary. Options granted under the Plan may contain such terms and provisions not inconsistent with the
Plan that the Committee shall deem advisable in its sole and absolute discretion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) <I>ISO Limitations</I>. No ISO shall be granted to any person who

applicable provisions of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code. Any ISO granted under the Plan may be modified by the Committee, with the consent of the Participant, to disqualify such Option from treatment as an &#147;incentive stock option&#148; under
Section&nbsp;422 of the Code. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares with respect to which Options designated as ISOs first become exercisable by a Participant in any calendar year (under this Plan and any other plan of the
Company or any Affiliate) exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall automatically be treated as Non-ISOs. For purposes of determining whether the $100,000 limit is exceeded, the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to an ISO shall be determined
as of the Grant Date. In reducing the number of Options treated as ISOs to meet the $100,000 limit, the most recently granted Options shall be reduced first. In the event that Section&nbsp;422 of the Code is amended to alter the limitation set forth

an ISO granted to an Employee who is a Ten Percent Holder on the Grant Date, the term of the ISO shall not exceed five years from the Grant Date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d)

adjustment or action would cause the Plan to violate Section&nbsp;422(b)(1) of the Code. Furthermore, no such adjustment or action shall be authorized to the extent such adjustment or action would result in short-swing profits liability under
Section&nbsp;16 or violate the exemptive conditions of Rule&nbsp;16b-3 unless the Committee determines that the Award is not to comply with such exemptive conditions. No action shall be taken under this Section&nbsp;13 which shall cause an Award to
