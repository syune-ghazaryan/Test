<FONT SIZE=2>February&nbsp;28, 2017

</FONT>

</P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Stockholders: </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>The
Board of Directors of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation ("<U>Cypress</U>," the "<U>Company</U>," "<U>we</U>,"
"<U>us</U>" or "<U>our</U>") is writing to solicit your consents on behalf of the Company to approve an amendment to the Company's Second Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (the "<U>Certificate of Incorporation</U>") to eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors, which the Board of Directors approved and
declared advisable at a meeting on February&nbsp;16, 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>


In order to save the expense associated with holding a special meeting of the Company's stockholders, the Board of Directors elected at its meeting on February&nbsp;16, 2017 to obtain stockholder
approval of the amendment described above by written consent pursuant to Section&nbsp;228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, rather than by calling a meeting of stockholders. This consent
solicitation statement and enclosed written consent form are being sent to our stockholders on or about March&nbsp;1, 2017.

 </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;">


<FONT SIZE=2><B>Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you consent to the approval of the proposed amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation. Although our Board of Directors
approved the proposed amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation at its meeting on February&nbsp;16, 2017, the amendment must also be approved by a majority of our outstanding shares of common
stock as of February&nbsp;27, 2017, which the Board of Directors set as the record date for these consents. As a result, the amendment will be approved when we have received consents to the approval
of the amendment from stockholders representing a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding on the record date. The Board of Directors determined that the consents must be received on or
before March&nbsp;24, 2017; however, this date may be extended by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.</B></FONT>

</P>

<P style="font-family:times;">


<FONT SIZE=2><B>Your response is important regardless of the number of shares of stock that you hold. If you consent to the approval of the proposed amendment, please mark the "CONSENT" box on
the enclosed written consent form to vote in favor of the proposed amendment. If you do not consent to the approval of the proposed amendment, please mark the "WITHHOLD CONSENT" box on the enclosed
written consent form to vote against the proposed amendment. Please complete, date, sign and return your written consent form to our proxy solicitor, Okapi Partners&nbsp;LLC, by email at
cyinfo@okapipartners.com, by facsimile at (212)&nbsp;297-1710 or by mail at Okapi Partners&nbsp;LLC, 1212&nbsp;Avenue of the Americas, 24th&nbsp;Floor, New York, New York&nbsp;10036 by
March&nbsp;24, 2017. Abstentions, broker non-votes and failures to vote will have the same effect as withheld consents and will be treated as votes against the amendment.</B></FONT>

Information Regarding Consents  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>This Consent Solicitation Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of stockholder consents by the Board of Directors of Cypress
Semiconductor Corporation. References to "<U>Cypress</U>," the "<U>Company</U>," "<U>we</U>," "<U>us</U>" and
"<U>our</U>" in this Consent Solicitation Statement mean Cypress Semiconductor Corporation. Our Board of Directors is soliciting these consents in lieu of a meeting of
stockholders in order to obtain our stockholders' approval of the proposal of the following amendment to the Company's Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "<U>Certificate of
Incorporation</U>"), which the Company's Board of Directors approved and declared advisable at a meeting on February&nbsp;16, 2017:</FONT></P>

Board of Directors has also approved (i)&nbsp;an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "<U>Bylaws</U>") to adopt a majority vote standard for the
election of directors in uncontested elections and a plurality vote standard for the election of directors in contested elections, implement proxy access and eliminate certain duplicative cumulative
voting procedures, and (ii)&nbsp;the adoption of a director resignation policy in connection with the majority voting Bylaw amendment, in each case to be effective following stockholder approval of
the above proposal, as discussed below in the section titled "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Proposal to Be Acted Upon By Stockholders&#151;Summary of Bylaw Amendments and Corporate Governance Policy

We are incorporated in the State of Delaware and are therefore subject to Title 8 of the Delaware Code. Section&nbsp;228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits our stockholders to take
action without a meeting if the votes represented by consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, represent a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company entitled to vote thereon. The Board of Directors determined on February&nbsp;24, 2017 that the consents must be received on or before March&nbsp;24, 2017; however, this date may be
extended by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. Accordingly, if we receive executed consents approving the above proposal from the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the
Company's common stock on or before March&nbsp;24, 2017 (unless the Board of Directors extends this date), the proposal set forth herein will be approved.

with the Section&nbsp;220 Demand and submitted nominations for two candidates for election to the Company's Board of Directors at the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the
"<U>2017 Annual Meeting</U>"). In an effort to avoid a costly proxy contest with Mr.&nbsp;Rodgers, the Company offered to expand the Board of Directors from seven to eight
directors and appoint one of Mr.&nbsp;Rodgers' nominees to the Board of Directors, conditioned upon Mr.&nbsp;Rodgers' dismissing his lawsuit against the Company and entering into customary
standstill and non-disparagement provisions. However, Mr.&nbsp;Rodgers rejected this proposal. After careful consideration, the Board of Directors has determined it is not in the best interests of
the Company or its stockholders to add Mr.&nbsp;Rodgers' nominees under these terms and has rejected his demands. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>Regarding
Mr.&nbsp;Rodgers' lawsuit, the Company's independent directors and outside counsel reviewed his claims and determined that they are speculative and without merit. The Company is committed
to best-in-class corporate governance practices and has clear policies in place at all levels of the Company to ensure that it takes the appropriate steps to guard against conflicts of interest. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>While
this Consent Solicitation Statement is not being furnished in connection with the election of directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting, it relates to voting policies which, if approved, would be
effective for the election of directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting. Specifically, if the proposal to eliminate cumulative voting is approved by our stockholders, majority voting in uncontested
elections, and plurality voting in contested elections, will apply. Accordingly, the ability of minority stockholders, like Mr.&nbsp;Rodgers, to elect nominees to the Board of Directors will be
reduced. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>The Board of Directors is proposing, for approval by our stockholders, an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate cumulative
voting in the election of directors. As discussed below, the Board of Directors believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to eliminate cumulative voting. </FONT></P>

<!-- COMMAND=STYLE_ADDED,"margin-left:10.0pt;text-indent:-10.0pt;" -->


Summary of Amendment  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>Under Delaware law, stockholders do not have the right to vote their shares cumulatively in any election of directors unless a company's certificate of
incorporation provides otherwise. Article&nbsp;VIII of our Certificate of Incorporation currently expressly authorizes cumulative voting in all director elections. Cumulative voting enables a
stockholder to concentrate his or her voting power by allocating to one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected, multiplied by the number of shares held by that
stockholder, or to distribute those votes among two or more candidates. Consequently, a stockholder or group of stockholders holding a relatively small number of shares may be able to elect one or
more directors by cumulating votes. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>As
amended, Article&nbsp;VIII would eliminate cumulative voting in all elections of directors. The text of Article&nbsp;VIII, as proposed to be amended, would read as follows (additions are
indicated by underlining and deletions are indicated by strikeouts): </FONT></P>

Reasons for Amendment  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>The Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to eliminate cumulative voting in all director
elections for the following reasons: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I> Annual Elections.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with the annual election of directors, cumulative
voting increases the chances that a minority stockholder could take disruptive actions in opposition to the wishes of the holders of a majority of the shares voting.  </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I> Majority Voting.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors has determined that cumulative
voting is incompatible, and fundamentally at odds, with a majority vote standard because it allows relatively small stockholders to elect directors who are not supported by a majority of the Company's
stockholder base. The Company and the Board of Directors believe that each director should represent the interests of all stockholders rather than the interests of a minority stockholder or a special
constituency and that cumulative voting could lead to directors having improper incentives. The Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the Company's Bylaws to implement a majority voting
standard for uncontested elections and a plurality voting standard for contested elections, and in connection therewith, the adoption of a director resignation policy, both of which will become
effective following stockholder approval of this proposal. For a detailed description of the majority voting Bylaw amendments and the director resignation </FONT></DD></DL>

<DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I> Proxy Access.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors has also approved an amendment to the
Bylaws to include a proxy access provision permitting stockholders to include stockholder-nominated director candidates in the Company's proxy materials, which amendment will become effective
following stockholder approval of this proposal. When combined with this proxy access right, cumulative voting could produce adverse consequences. Cumulative voting increases the risk that minority
stockholders with a small economic interest in the Company could take advantage of the proxy access right to elect directors who are unsupported by a large percentage of the Company's stockholders.
Minority stockholders with special interests and goals inconsistent with those of the majority of stockholders could use the proxy access right coupled with cumulative voting to elect a director whose
interests are in accord with the minority group responsible for his or her election, rather than with the Company and all of its stockholders. The election of such directors could result in
partisanship and discord on the Board of Directors and may impair the ability of the Board to act in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders. For a detailed description of the
proxy access Bylaw amendments, see the section entitled "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>&#151;Summary of Bylaw Amendments and Corporate Governance Policy Changes&#151;Proxy

prevailing election standard among large U.S. public companies, favored by a substantial majority of the companies in the S&amp;P&nbsp;500 and the Fortune 500. Very few publicly traded companies
continue to provide for cumulative voting in their governing documents. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>Accordingly,
the Board of Directors unanimously views this proposal as an appropriate balancing measure in light of the annual elections of the Company's directors and the majority voting and proxy
access provisions proposed to be included in the Company's Bylaws. On February&nbsp;16, 2017, the Board of Directors adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable the proposed amendment to
the Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors and recommending that stockholders also approve the proposed amendment. The Board of Directors also adopted
resolutions (i)&nbsp;amending the Bylaws to provide for majority voting in uncontested elections of directors, allow for stockholder "proxy access" and eliminate certain duplicative cumulative
voting procedures and (ii)&nbsp;adopting a director resignation policy in connection with the proposed Bylaw amendment to implement majority voting in uncontested elections of directors, in each
case to become effective following stockholder approval of this proposal. If stockholders approve this proposal, the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation will become effective upon the filing
of a certificate of amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State, which we anticipate doing as soon as practicable following stockholder approval, and the amendment to the Bylaws and the adoption of
the director resignation policy will become effective immediately upon the filing of such certificate of amendment. </FONT></P>

Summary of Bylaw Amendments and Corporate Governance Policy Changes  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>The Board of Directors has approved an amendment to the Bylaws to provide for majority voting in uncontested elections of directors, include stockholder
"proxy access" provisions and eliminate certain duplicative cumulative voting procedures, to become effective after the stockholders approve the proposal to amend to the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation to eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors. In conjunction with the Bylaw amendments to implement majority voting in uncontested elections of directors, the Board of
Directors has also approved the adoption of a Director Resignation Policy (the "<U>Director Resignation Policy</U>") for directors who fail to receive a majority vote in an
uncontested election. </FONT></P>

maximum number of stockholder-nominated candidates would be the closest whole number below 20%. Based on the Company's current Board size of 7 directors, the maximum number of proxy access candidates
that the Company would be required to include in its proxy materials for an annual meeting is two. The number of permitted candidates would include nominees submitted under the proxy access procedures
that were either later withdrawn or that the Board of Directors subsequently determined to include in that year's proxy materials as Board-nominated candidates. If the number of stockholder-nominated
candidates exceeds 20%, each nominating stockholder would select one nominee for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials until the maximum number is reached. The order of selection would be
determined by the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the Company's common stock held by each nominating stockholder or group of stockholders.  </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, or by the chairman of the Board, or by the president, or by one or more
stockholders <STRIKE>holding</STRIKE> <U>owning</U> shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than ten percent<U> (10%)</U> of
the votes at that meeting. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>For purposes of this Section&nbsp;2.3, a stockholder shall be deemed to "own" only those outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation as to which the stockholder
possesses both (i)&nbsp;the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (ii)&nbsp;the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such
shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses&nbsp;(i) and (ii)&nbsp;shall not include any shares (x)&nbsp;sold by such stockholder or any of its affiliates in
any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (y)&nbsp;borrowed by such stockholder or any of its affiliates for any purposes or purchased by such stockholder or any of its affiliates
pursuant to an agreement to resell or (z)&nbsp;subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar instrument or agreement entered into by such
stockholder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of shares of outstanding common stock of
the corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (1)&nbsp;reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future,
such stockholder's or affiliates' full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (2)&nbsp;hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full
economic ownership of such shares by such stockholder or affiliate. A stockholder shall "own" shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the stockholder retains the right to
instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A stockholder's ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue
during any period in which the stockholder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement which is revocable at any time by the stockholder or
has loaned such shares so long as the stockholder has the power to recall such loaned shares on five&nbsp;(5) business days' notice, and has recalled the loaned shares by the record date of the
relevant special meeting, and the stockholder holds the recalled shares through the date of the special meeting of stockholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof. The terms "owned," "owning"
and other variations of the word "own" shall have correlative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of the common stock of the corporation are "owned" for these purposes shall be determined by the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;2.3, the term "affiliate" or "affiliates" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term under the 1934
Act.</U>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;2.12 of these Bylaws,
subject to the provisions of Sections&nbsp;217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts
and other voting agreements). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
stockholders' vote may be by voice vote, by electronic or other wireless vote, or in writing. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
<STRIKE>as provided in the last paragraph of this Section&nbsp;2.9 or </STRIKE>as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each
stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRIKE>At a stockholders' meeting at which directors are to be elected, each stockholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e.,&nbsp;cast for any candidate a number of
votes greater than the number of votes which such stockholder normally is entitled to cast) if the candidates names have been properly placed in nomination (in accordance with these Bylaws). Each
holder of stock, or of any class or classes or of a series or series thereof, who elects to cumulate votes shall be entitled to as many votes as equals the number of votes which (absent this provision
as to cumulative voting) he would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to his shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected by him, and he may cast all
of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them, as he may see fit.</STRIKE>

 </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
stockholder entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or, except when the matter is the
election of directors<U> and plurality voting applies</U>, may vote them against the proposal; but if the stockholder fails to specify the
number of shares which the stockholder is voting affirmatively, it will be conclusively presumed that the stockholder's approving vote is with respect to all shares which the stockholder is entitled
to vote. </FONT></P>

all matters other than the election of directors, e</STRIKE><U>E</U>xcept as otherwise provided by the express provisions of the
law of the state of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting at which a
quorum is present shall be the act of the stockholders and shall be valid and binding upon the corporation. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in Section&nbsp;3.4 of these Bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual
meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director,
including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until
his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Each
director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the nominee at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is
present, provided, however, that the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors and
cast in the election of directors at any meeting of stockholders for which (i)&nbsp;the secretary of the corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the
Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice or proxy access requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in Sections&nbsp;2.15 or 2.16 of these Bylaws, respectively, and
(ii)&nbsp;such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or prior to the tenth (10th) day preceding the date the corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the
stockholders. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;3.3, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a nominee must exceed the votes cast "against" such nominee's
election.</U> </FONT></P>
