of the Share Increase Amendments adopted at the Company&#146;s Annual Meetings and the Reverse Stock Split Amendment adopted at the 2016 Special Meeting, as, with respect to the Annual Meetings and the 2016 Special Meeting, certain shares of common
stock held through brokers/nominees and with respect to which the beneficial owner had not provided the broker/nominee with voting instructions, were voted by the broker/nominee in favor of the approval of the Share Increase Amendments and the
Reverse Stock Split Amendment in accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange that govern how brokers may cast such votes. Certain statements made in the Company&#146;s definitive proxy statements for the Annual Meetings and the 2016
Special Meeting were inconsistent with this approach. In particular, the Company&#146;s definitive proxy statements for the Annual Meetings and the 2016 Special Meeting stated that brokers/nominees would not have discretionary voting authority on
the Share Increase Amendments and the Reverse Stock Split </P>

NASDAQ stated in the Notification Letter that, in accordance with Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had been provided a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until February&nbsp;7, 2017, in which to regain compliance with the minimum

additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities. Delisting would have also likely negatively affected the value and liquidity of our Common Stock because alternatives, such as the OTC Bulletin Board and the pink sheets,

ADDRESS </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for Special Meeting
materials with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single set of Special Meeting materials addressed to those stockholders. This process, commonly referred to as &#147;householding,&#148; potentially provides
extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. Because we utilize the &#147;householding&#148; rules for Special Meeting materials, stockholders who share the same address will receive only one copy of the Special Meeting
materials, unless we receive contrary instructions from any stockholder at that address. If you prefer to receive multiple copies of the Special Meeting materials at the same address you share with other stockholders, additional copies will be
provided to you promptly upon request. If you are a stockholder of record, you may obtain additional copies at the same address you share with other stockholders by calling us at (925)&nbsp;498-7709 or upon written request to Galena Biopharma, Inc.,
Attn: Investor Relations, 2000 Crow Canyon Place, Suite 380, San Ramon, California 94583. Eligible stockholders of record receiving multiple copies of the Special Meeting materials can request householding by contacting us in the same manner. If you
are a beneficial owner and hold your shares in a brokerage or custody account, you can request additional copies of the Special Meeting materials at the same address you share with other stockholders or you can request householding by notifying your
broker, bank or other nominee. </P>  <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS </B></P>
