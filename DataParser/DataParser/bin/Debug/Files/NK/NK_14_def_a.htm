When proxies are properly dated, executed and returned, the shares represented by such proxies will be voted at the annual meeting in accordance with the instruction of the stockholder. If no specific instructions are given, however, the shares will

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Broker non-votes occur when a beneficial owner of shares held in &#147;street name&#148; does not give instructions to the broker holding the
shares as to how to vote on matters deemed &#147;non-routine&#148; and there is at least one &#147;routine&#148; matter to be voted upon at the meeting. Generally, if shares are held in street name, the beneficial owner of the shares is entitled to
give voting instructions to the broker holding the shares. If the beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions, the broker can still vote the shares with respect to matters that are considered to be &#147;routine,&#148; but not with respect
to &#147;non-routine&#148; matters. In the event that a broker votes shares on the &#147;routine&#148; matters, but does not vote shares on the &#147;non-routine&#148; matters, those shares will be treated as broker non-votes with respect to the
&#147;non-routine&#148; proposals. Accordingly, if you own shares through a nominee, such as a broker or bank, please be sure to instruct your nominee how to vote to ensure that your vote is counted on each of the proposals. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An abstention represents a stockholder&#146;s affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. If a stockholder indicates on its proxy card
that it wishes to abstain from voting its shares, or if a broker, bank or other nominee holding its customers&#146; shares of record causes abstentions to be recorded for shares, these shares will be considered present and entitled to vote at the
annual meeting. As a result, abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum and will also count as votes against a proposal in cases where approval of the proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting (<I>e.g.</I>, Proposal No.&nbsp;2). However, because the outcome of Proposal No.&nbsp;1 (election of directors) will be determined by a
plurality vote, abstentions will have no impact on the outcome of such proposal as long as a quorum exists. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Broker non-votes will be
counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the annual meeting but will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes cast. Therefore, a broker non-vote will make a quorum more readily attainable but will not
otherwise affect the outcome of the vote on any proposal. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? </B></P>

may vote (i)&nbsp;&#147;FOR&#148; each director or (ii)&nbsp;&#147;WITHHOLD&#148; for each director nominee. Because the outcome of this proposal will be determined by a plurality vote, shares voted &#147;WITHHOLD&#148; will have no impact on the

global health information and next generation pharmaceutical development network, for the secure sharing of genetic and medical information. Dr.&nbsp;Soon-Shiong, a physician, surgeon and scientist, has pioneered novel therapies for both diabetes
and cancer, published over 100 scientific papers, and has over 230 issued patents on groundbreaking advancements spanning a myriad of fields. Dr.&nbsp;Soon-Shiong performed the world&#146;s first encapsulated human islet transplant, the first
engineered islet cell transplant, and the first pig to man islet cell transplant in diabetic patients. He invented and developed Abraxane, the nation&#146;s first FDA approved protein nanoparticle albumin-bound delivery technology for the treatment
of cancer. Abraxane was approved by the FDA for metastatic breast cancer in 2005, lung cancer in 2012, and pancreatic cancer in 2013. Abraxane is now approved in many countries across the globe. From 1997 to 2010, Dr.&nbsp;Soon-Shiong served as

Dr.&nbsp;Soon-Shiong serves as Chairman of the Chan Soon-Shiong Family Foundation and Chairman and CEO of the Chan Soon-Shiong Institute of Molecular Medicine, a nonprofit medical research organization. He currently co-chairs the CEO Council for

Distinguished Medical Science Award. Dr.&nbsp;Soon-Shiong holds a degree in medicine from the University of the Witwatersrand and a M.Sc. in science from the University of British Columbia. We believe that Dr.&nbsp;Soon-Shiong is qualified to serve
as a member of our board of directors due to his depth of expertise as chairman and chief executive officer of multiple multi-billion dollar companies in the life sciences industry, his broad experience in research and development of pioneering
technologies, and his educational background. Pursuant to the Subscription and Investment Agreement between us and Cambridge Equities, LP, or Cambridge, Cambridge has the ability to designate one director who shall be nominated by our corporate

standing risk management committee, but rather administers this oversight function directly through the board of directors as a whole, as well as through its standing committees that address risks inherent in their respective areas of oversight. In
particular, our board of directors is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure. Our audit committee is responsible for reviewing and discussing our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to
monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. Our audit committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and reviews related party transactions,
in addition to oversight of the performance of our external audit function. Our board of directors monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines. Our compensation committee assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation
policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. The board believes its leadership structure is consistent with and supports the administration of its risk oversight function. </P>

development and license agreement with Sorrento to exclusively collaborate on the development and commercialization of therapeutic applications of certain effector cell lines as may be agreed between the parties, which exclusivity extends to certain
rights of each party included in each agreed collaboration. Pursuant to this agreement, the parties have agreed to use certain of our NK-92 cells exclusively with Sorrento&#146;s CARs and certain other CARs not excluded under the agreement to
develop and commercialize joint products as may be agreed between the parties. To fund our joint research and development efforts, Sorrento has agreed to make research credit payments that are not material in each of December 2015 and 2016, which
amounts would be reduced by certain expenses for which we are responsible under the agreement. The research credit payments will be paid in the Form&nbsp;of full-time employee expense credits by Sorrento, for our portion of any development costs,
and a laboratory credit for maintaining a laboratory on Sorrento&#146;s premises. Each joint product developed by the parties will be driven by one party, as mutually agreed upon by a designated steering committee comprised of three representatives
from each party. That designated party, in each circumstance, will initiate and control development, testing, regulatory approval, commercialization, and, subject to certain conditions, out-licensing of the applicable joint product, and will bear
all costs associated with the development of the joint cell line or joint product, including any costs associated with obtaining any necessary rights to third party intellectual property, unless the other party shares in such costs. Revenues
generated from each joint cell line or joint product will be apportioned between Sorrento and us, depending upon the stage of development and each party&#146;s contribution towards the development costs. As of the date hereof, the parties have not
yet agreed upon any projects under the joint development and license agreement; therefore Sorrento has no rights to use our NK cells or other technologies or intellectual property rights or to begin related research, development or commercialization
activities and we are free to pursue, and are actively pursuing, research, development and commercialization activities with antibodies that may bind to various targets, including PDL1, ROR-1, CD33 and CD123. The agreement expires upon later of the
completion of the series of our collaborative research and development efforts or three years. We and Sorrento each have the right to terminate the agreement and the licenses granted thereunder if the other party is dissolved or is declared bankrupt
or insolvent or remains in default of any material obligations following a sixty day cure period to remedy the default. </P>
