As the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote in person at the Special Meeting. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another Intermediary, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name. As the beneficial owner, you are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, since a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a &#8220;legal proxy&#8221; from the Intermediary (usually your broker) that is the record holder of the shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the Special </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Whether you hold shares directly as a registered stockholder of record or beneficially in street name, you may vote without attending the Special Meeting. You may vote by granting a proxy or, for shares held beneficially in street name, by submitting voting instructions to your broker, bank or other Intermediary. In most cases, you will be able to do this by using the Internet, by telephone or by mail. </div>

If you provide specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted as you have instructed. </div>

        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions? </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">If you are a stockholder of record and you either indicate when voting on the Internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board, or you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board with respect to Proposal 1 and Proposal 2 and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Special Meeting. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the Intermediary that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, under stock market rules, the Intermediary that holds your shares may generally vote at its discretion only on routine matters and cannot vote on non-routine matters. If the Intermediary that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, the Intermediary will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on such matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a &#8220;broker non-vote.&#8221; For non-routine matters, broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast on such matters and, therefore, will not affect the outcome of Proposal 1 or Proposal 2 (which require the approval of a majority of votes properly cast in person or by proxy). </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Are Proposal 1 and Proposal 2 considered &#8220;routine&#8221; or &#8220;non-routine&#8221;? </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Each of Proposal 1 and Proposal 2 is considered a non-routine matter under applicable rules. A broker or other Intermediary cannot vote shares held in street name without specific voting instructions on non-routine matters, and therefore we expect there to be broker non-votes on Proposal 1 and Proposal 2. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">What if I am party to a voting agreement related to Proposal 1 and Proposal 2? </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Under the terms of each of the voting agreements entered into between Amyris and each of Total Raffinage Chimie S.A., Maxwell (Mauritius) Pte Ltd, Foris Ventures, LLC, Naxyris S.A., Biolding Investment SA and certain other investors, respectively, each stockholder who is a party to such agreements has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in such voting agreement, to vote the shares of our Common Stock subject to the voting agreement for the approval of Proposal 1 and Proposal 2. As of the record date, the parties to the voting agreements beneficially owned and were entitled to vote approximately 48.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting. The inspector of election will separately count &#8220;For&#8221; and &#8220;Against&#8221; votes, abstentions and any broker non-votes. Abstentions will be counted toward the vote total for the proposals and will have the same effect as an &#8220;Against&#8221; vote for Proposal 1 and Proposal 2. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Proposal 1 must receive a &#8220;For&#8221; vote from the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock casting votes in person or by proxy on Proposal 1 at the Special Meeting. Abstentions will be counted toward the vote total for Proposal 1 and will have the same effect as an &#8220;Against&#8221; vote for Proposal 1. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">What is the vote required to approve Proposal 2? </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the final vote at the Special Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may do this by signing and submitting a new proxy card with a later date, by using the Internet or voting by telephone (either of which must be completed by 11:59&#160;p.m., Pacific Time on July&#160;6, 2017 &#8212; your latest telephone or Internet proxy is counted), or by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person. Attending the Special Meeting alone will not revoke your proxy unless you specifically request that your proxy be revoked.

The final voting results will be reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which we expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days after the Special Meeting. If final voting results are not available within four business days after the Special Meeting, we intend to file a current report on Form 8-K reporting the preliminary voting results within that period, and subsequently file the final voting results in an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days after the final voting results are known to us. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5635(d) requires stockholder approval in connection with a transaction other than a public offering involving the sale or issuance by the issuer of common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock) equal to 20% or more of the common stock or 20% or more of the voting power outstanding before the issuance for a price that is less than the greater of book or market value of the stock on the date the company enters into a binding agreement for the issuance of such securities. Based on a market price on May&#160;5, 2017 of&#8201;&#8201;$0.54 per share, the issuance of the Preferred Stock and Warrants may be deemed to involve the issuance of securities convertible into more than 20% of our Common Stock at a discount to the market value of our Common Stock on the date of execution of the binding agreement to issue such securities. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5635(c) requires stockholder approval of security issuances at below fair market value made to officers, directors, employees or consultants, or affiliated entities of any such persons. Proposal 1 will result in shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants sold to entities affiliated with directors John Doerr, Carole Piwnica and Philip Eykerman becoming convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock at a price which may be deemed to be below the fair market value of our Common Stock at the time the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement (as outlined above). By approving Proposal 1, you are approving the proposal for purposes of the requirements under NASDAQ Marketplace Rules 5635(b), (c), and (d), which will result in the issuance of Common Stock upon conversion or exercise, as applicable, of the Preferred Stock and Warrants issued in the Offering. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">We are requesting in this Proposal 1 that our stockholders approve the issuance of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and exercise of the Warrants in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rules 5635(b), (c), and (d). The issuance and sale of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants are intended to be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to the Regulation D &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; provisions of the Securities Act. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Voting Agreements </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Under the terms of the voting agreements entered into between Amyris and each of Total, Temasek, Foris, Naxyris, Biolding Investment SA and certain other investors, respectively, each stockholder who is a party to such agreements has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in such voting agreement, to vote the shares of our Common Stock subject to the voting agreement for the approval of Proposal 1. As of the record date, the parties to the voting agreements beneficially owned and were entitled to vote approximately 48.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Use of Proceeds </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">We used approximately $9.5 million of the net proceeds from the Offering for the redemption of convertible notes issued by the Company in December&#160;2016 and April&#160;2017, and we currently intend to use the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Stockholders should understand that we have wide discretion over the use of proceeds from the Offering. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Potential Adverse Effects&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Dilution and Impact of the Offering on Existing Stockholders </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The issuance of the Preferred Stock and Warrants could have a dilutive effect on current stockholders who are not participating in the Offering in that the percentage ownership of the Company held by such current stockholders will decline as a result of the issuance of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion </div>

This means also that our current stockholders who are not participating in the Offering will own a smaller interest in us as a result of the Offering and therefore have less ability to influence significant corporate decisions requiring stockholder approval. Issuance of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock and exercise of the Warrants could also have a dilutive effect on book value per share and any future earnings per share. Dilution of equity interests could also cause prevailing market prices for our Common Stock to decline. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Because of potential adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock and exercise of the Warrants to be issued in connection with the Offering, the exact magnitude of the dilutive effect of the Preferred Stock and Warrants cannot be conclusively determined. However, the dilutive effect may be material to current stockholders of the Company. </div>

In particular, director John Doerr is affiliated with Foris, director Carole Piwnica was appointed to serve on our Board by Naxyris pursuant to its contractual rights with us, and director Philip Eykerman is affiliated with, and was appointed to serve on our Board by, DSM pursuant to its contractual rights with us (collectively, the &#8220;Affiliated Investors&#8221;). The beneficial ownership of such Affiliated Investors (other than DSM, which purchased shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants in the Offering, as described above) is outlined below in the Section titled <font style="font-style:italic;">Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management</font>. Each of Foris, Naxyris and DSM have purchased shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants that will not become exercisable if Proposal 1 is not approved. None of Foris, Naxyris, DSM or any other investor who participated in the Offering will, by virtue of such transactions, including by the conversion of the Preferred Stock or the exercise of the Warrants issued to such investor, acquire rights to a majority of the voting power of the Company. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Offering was separately approved by the Pricing Committee of the Board, and none of Mr. Doerr, Ms. Piwnica or Mr. Eykerman was a member of, nor participated in, any meetings of the Pricing Committee. </div>

In addition, in considering the various factors, individual members of the Board may have assigned different weights to different factors. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Our Common Stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market (&#8220;NASDAQ&#8221;) and trades under the ticker symbol AMRS. NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5635(b) requires stockholder approval of security issuances when the issuance or potential issuance will result in a change of control of the company. NASDAQ has generally taken the position that any issuance that results in an investor or group of investors obtaining a 20% or greater interest or a right to acquire that interest on a post-transaction basis, and that ownership position would be the largest position in the company, would be presumed to be a change of control. If the Second Tranche Funding is consummated in full, including the full exercise of the warrants issuable thereunder, DSM may own greater than 20% of the voting power of the Company on a post-transaction basis and be the Company&#8217;s largest shareholder. By approving Proposal 2, you are </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5635(d) requires stockholder approval in connection with a transaction other than a public offering involving the sale or issuance by the issuer of common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock) equal to 20% or more of the common stock or 20% or more of the voting power outstanding before the issuance for a price that is less than the greater of book or market value of the stock on the date the company enters into a binding agreement for the issuance of such securities. The issuance of any Common Stock, preferred stock and warrants to be sold in the Additional Offerings may be deemed to involve the issuance of securities convertible into more than 20% of our Common Stock at a discount to the market value of our Common Stock on the date of execution of the binding agreement to issue such securities. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5635(c) requires stockholder approval of security issuances at below fair market value made to officers, directors, employees or consultants, or affiliated entities of any such persons. Proposal 2 may result in the issuance of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock to entities affiliated with members of our Board of Directors, including DSM, at a price deemed to be below the fair market value of our Common Stock at the time the Company enters into the purchase agreement relating to such Additional Offering. By approving Proposal 2, you are approving the proposal for purposes of the requirements under NASDAQ Marketplace Rules 5635(b), (c), and (d), which may result in the issuance of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">We are requesting in this Proposal 2 that our stockholders approve the issuance of Common Stock, including shares of our Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of preferred stock and the exercise of warrants, in the Additional Offerings in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rules 5635(b), (c), and (d). We anticipate that the issuance and sale of the shares of Common Stock, including shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of preferred stock and the exercise of warrants, in the Additional Offerings will be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to the Regulation D &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; provisions of the Securities Act. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Under the terms of the voting agreements entered into between Amyris and each of Total, Temasek, Foris, Naxyris, Biolding Investment SA and certain other investors, respectively, each stockholder who is a party to such agreements has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in such voting agreement, to vote the shares of our Common Stock subject to the voting agreement for the approval of Proposal 2. As of the record date, the parties to the voting agreements beneficially owned and were entitled to vote approximately 48.9% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">We currently intend to use the net proceeds from any Additional Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of indebtedness. Stockholders should understand that we have wide discretion over the use of proceeds. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The issuance of the Common Stock, preferred stock and/or warrants in the Additional Offerings could have a dilutive effect on current stockholders who are not participating in the Additional Offerings in that the percentage ownership of the Company held by such current stockholders will decline as a result of the issuance of the Common Stock, including shares of our Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of preferred stock and the exercise of warrants, issuable in the Additional Offerings. This means also that our current stockholders who are not participating in the Additional Offerings will own a smaller interest in us as a result of the Additional Offerings and therefore have less ability to influence significant corporate decisions requiring stockholder approval.

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Because the total number of shares that may be issued in Additional Offerings is dependent upon the per share price at which such shares are sold, the exact magnitude of the dilutive effect of the securities to be issued in the Additional Offerings cannot be conclusively determined. However, the dilutive effect may be material to current stockholders of the Company. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Interests of Certain Persons </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">When you consider the Board&#8217;s recommendation to vote in favor of Proposal 2, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers and existing stockholders may have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of other of our stockholders. In particular, DSM, which is affiliated with director Philip Eykerman, has agreed to negotiate in good faith with the Company during the 90-day period following the closing of the Offering to mutually agree on certain terms and conditions upon which DSM will, subject to certain conditions, including the approval of DSM&#8217;s managing board, purchase additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock and warrants, on terms to be agreed, in an amount to be agreed by the Company and DSM, provided such amount is no less than $25 million and no more than $30 million. Such shares of Series B Preferred Stock will not become convertible and such warrants will not become exercisable if Proposal 2 is not approved. Neither DSM nor any other investor who participates in the Additional Offerings will, by virtue of such transactions, including by the conversion of any preferred stock or the exercise of any warrants issued to such investor in the Additional Offerings, acquire rights to a majority of the voting power of the Company. </div>

These rules also treat as outstanding all shares of capital stock that a person would receive upon the exercise of any option, warrant or right or through the conversion of a security held by that person that are immediately exercisable or convertible or exercisable or convertible within 60 days of the date as of which beneficial ownership is determined. These shares are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding those options, warrants or rights or convertible securities for the purpose of computing the number of shares beneficially owned and the percentage ownership of that person, but they are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. The information does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Except as indicated in the footnotes to the below table and pursuant to applicable community property laws, to our knowledge the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Common Stock attributed to them in the table. </div>

Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be &#8220;householding&#8221; communications to your address, &#8220;householding&#8221; will continue until you are notified otherwise or you submit contrary instructions.

In addition, we will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the Notice or other proxy materials to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of such documents was delivered. </div>
