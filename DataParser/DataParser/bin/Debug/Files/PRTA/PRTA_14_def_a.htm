internet and mailing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to shareholders of record as of March&nbsp;13, 2017 (the &#147;Record Date&#148;). Brokers and other nominees who hold shares on behalf of beneficial owners will be sending
their own similar notice. All shareholders as of the Record Date will have the ability to access our proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or request to receive a printed set of the
proxy materials. Instructions on how to request a printed copy by mail or electronically may be found in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and on the website referred to in the notice, including an option to request paper copies
on an ongoing basis. We intend to mail this Proxy Statement, together with the accompanying form of proxy card and Notice of Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, to those shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting who have properly
requested paper copies of such materials within three business days of request. </P>  <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The only voting securities of Prothena are ordinary
shares, $0.01 par value per share (&#147;ordinary shares&#148;). There were 37,940,930 ordinary shares issued and outstanding as of the Record Date.&nbsp;A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting and requires that the
shareholders holding a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. </P>

organization, who in turn hold through The Depository Trust Company (&#147;DTC&#148;), then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in &#147;street name&#148; and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. The
organization holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on how to vote the shares in your account. You are
also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy card from your broker or other agent who is the

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment of our independent accounting firm. The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG LLP, a
registered public accounting firm, as our independent accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2017, and our shareholders are being asked to ratify that appointment and authorize the
Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee, to approve the remuneration of KPMG LLP as our auditor. Neither our Constitution nor Irish law requires shareholder ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered
public accounting firm.&nbsp;Our Board is nonetheless submitting the appointment of KPMG LLP to our shareholders for ratification, in a non-binding vote, as a matter of good governance practice.&nbsp;The Board is also requesting that shareholders
authorize, in a binding vote, the Board, acting through its Audit Committee, to approve the remuneration of KPMG LLP as our auditor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If
our shareholders fail to ratify such appointment of KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain KPMG LLP, but may still determine to maintain its appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm
for our fiscal year 2017.&nbsp;Even if the appointment of KPMG LLP is ratified by our shareholders, the Audit Committee may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if the Committee determines that such a change
would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">KPMG LLP has audited our financial statements since the year ended

1,508,725 shares, 1,155,300 shares and 720,500 shares, respectively, under the current LTIP. This level of equity awards represents a three-year average burn rate of approximately 3.71% of weighted average ordinary shares outstanding. Equity burn
rate is calculated by dividing the number of shares subject to equity awards granted during the fiscal year (without adjusting for forfeitures) by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding during the fiscal year. </TD></TR></TABLE>

circumstances may require us to change our current equity grant practices. We cannot predict our future equity grant practices, the future price of our shares or future hiring activity with any degree of certainty at this time, and the share reserve

LTIP as of its effective date may be granted without regard to the foregoing minimum vesting requirement. For the purposes of awards to non-employee directors, a vesting period shall be deemed to be one year if it runs from the date of one annual
meeting of the Company&#146;s shareholders to the next annual meeting of the Company&#146;s shareholders, so long as the period between such meetings is not less than 50&nbsp;weeks. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stock options, including incentive stock options, as defined under Section&nbsp;422 of the Code, and nonqualified stock options may be granted
pursuant to the Amended and Restated LTIP. The exercise price of any stock option granted pursuant to the Amended and Restated LTIP will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the date of grant. The term of each
stock option will be determined by the Committee, but in no event will be longer than ten years after the date of grant. The terms of any incentive stock options shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code,
including that incentive stock options will be granted within ten years from the earlier of the date of adoption or shareholder approval of the Amended and Restated LTIP, as may be amended from time to time. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A restricted share award is the grant of ordinary shares at a per share purchase price determined
by the Committee (which may equal zero), that is nontransferable and may be subject to substantial risk of forfeiture until specific conditions on vesting determined by the Committee are met. During the period of restriction, participants holding
restricted shares may have full voting and dividend rights with respect to such shares; however, dividends may not be paid until the applicable restricted share vests. The restrictions will lapse in accordance with a schedule or other conditions
determined by the Committee. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Restricted share units may be awarded to any eligible individual, typically without payment of
consideration, but subject to vesting conditions based on continued employment or service or on performance criteria established by the Committee. Like restricted shares, restricted share units may not be sold, or otherwise transferred or
hypothecated, until vesting conditions are removed or expire. Unlike restricted shares, shares underlying restricted share units will not be issued until the restricted share units have vested, and recipients of restricted share units generally will
have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time when vesting conditions are satisfied. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dividend equivalent awards entitle
participants to receive the equivalent value (in cash or additional shares) of dividends in respect of other awards held by participants. Dividend equivalents may accrue on awards, but shall not be payable unless and until the applicable award
vests. Additionally, the Amended and Restated LTIP provides that dividend equivalents are not payable with respect to options or SARs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The other types of awards that may be granted under the Amended and Restated LTIP include performance awards and other share-based awards.
Performance awards, including cash bonuses and performance stock units, which are denominated in ordinary shares or their cash equivalents, may be linked to any one or more performance criteria determined appropriate by the Committee, in each case
on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the Committee. Other share-based awards are compensation that may be payable in or otherwise based on ordinary shares, including, without limitation, unrestricted shares
awarded purely as a bonus. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Committee may grant awards to employees who are or may be &#147;covered employees,&#148; as defined in
Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, that are intended to be performance-based awards within the meaning of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code in order to preserve the deductibility of these awards for federal income tax. Participants are only entitled to
receive payment for a performance-based award for any given performance period to the extent that pre-established performance goals set by the Committee for the period are satisfied. These pre-established performance goals must be based on one or
more of the following performance criteria: stock price, earnings per share, price-earnings multiples, net earnings, operating earnings, revenue, number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, productivity, margin, EBITDA (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), net capital employed, return on assets, shareholder return, return on equity, return on capital employed, growth in assets, unit volume, sales, cash flow, market share, or strategic business criteria
consisting of one or more objectives based on meeting specified revenue goals, market penetration goals, customer growth, geographic business expansion goals, cost targets or goals relating to acquisitions or divestitures, any of which may be
measured either in absolute terms or as compared to any incremental increase or decrease or as compared to results of a peer group or to market performance indicators or indices. The performance goals may relate to one or more business units or the
performance of the Company as a whole, or any combination of the foregoing. With regard to a particular performance period, the Committee has the discretion to select the length of the performance period, the type of performance-based awards to be
granted, and the goals that will be used to measure the performance for the period. In determining the actual size of an individual performance-based award for a performance period, the Committee may reduce or eliminate (but not increase) the award.

be obtained for any amendment to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation or securities exchange rule. In addition, the terms of outstanding awards may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of outstanding options or
the base amount of outstanding SARs or to cancel outstanding options or SARs in exchange for cash, other awards, options or SARs with an exercise price or base amount less than that of the original options or SARs without shareholder approval.
Further, no amendment or termination of the Amended and Restated LTIP may materially and adversely affect the rights of any participant pursuant to any award granted to the participant without his or her consent. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">No incentive stock options may be granted under the Amended and Restated LTIP after February&nbsp;22, 2027. </P>

exercised shall be assumed or substituted by the surviving corporation and other outstanding awards shall be converted into similar awards of the surviving corporation. If the surviving corporation refuses to assume or substitute for an award, the
award shall accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable upon the Change in Control and all restrictions on the award shall lapse, provided that any awards subject to performance-based vesting will vest based on the greater of (a)&nbsp;actual

reverse split, reorganization, merger, or other similar corporate transaction or event, including (i)&nbsp;adjusting the number and kind of shares issuable under the Amended and Restated LTIP, the number and kind of securities issued or issuable in

respect to nonqualified stock options, the Company is generally entitled to deduct and the optionee recognizes ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the time
of exercise. The gain or loss (in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value on the date of sale and the exercise price) upon disposition of such stock will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss, and the Company will
not be entitled to any deduction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to incentive stock options, if applicable holding period requirements are met (i.e., the
stock acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option is held for a minimum of two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise), the participant will not recognize taxable income at the time of exercise of the incentive
stock option. However, the excess of the fair market value of the ordinary shares received over the exercise price is an item of tax preference income potentially subject to the alternative minimum tax. The gain or loss (in an amount equal to the
difference between the fair market value on the date of sale and the exercise price) upon disposition of such stock will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss, and the Company will not be entitled to any deduction. If the holding period
requirements described above are not met, the incentive stock option will be treated as one which does not meet the requirements of the Code for incentive stock options and the tax consequences described for nonqualified stock options will apply,
although the amount of income recognized by the participant will be the lesser of (a)&nbsp;the excess of the fair market value of the shares </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The current federal income tax consequences of other awards authorized under the Amended and Restated LTIP generally follow certain basic
patterns: SARs are taxed and deductible in substantially the same manner as nonqualified stock options; nontransferable restricted shares subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and restricted share units will result in income recognition equal
to the excess of the fair market value over the price paid, if any, only at the time the restrictions applicable to such awards lapse (unless, with respect to an award of restricted shares, the recipient elects to accelerate recognition as of the
date of grant); share-based performance awards, dividend equivalents and other types of awards are generally subject to tax at ordinary income rates at the time of payment. In each of the foregoing cases, the Company will generally have a
corresponding deduction at the time the participant recognizes income, subject to Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code with respect to covered employees. </P>

respect to annual grants of stock options to our non-employee directors that will be made immediately following the date of the Annual Meeting, assuming shareholder approval of the Amended and Restated LTIP, all future awards under the Amended and
Restated LTIP are subject to the discretion of the Committee, and therefore it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be received in the future by other participants in the Amended and Restated LTIP (although the <I>Grants of Plan-Based
Awards - Fiscal Year 2016</I> table in this Proxy Statement describes all equity awards granted to our named executive officers during our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 under the current LTIP). Therefore, the table below provides

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Why we are presenting Proposal Nos. 5 and 6.</I></B> As a matter of Irish law, directors of an Irish public limited company must have
specific authority from shareholders to allot and issue any of the company&#146;s shares (other than pursuant to employee equity compensation plans).&nbsp;In addition, when the directors of an Irish public limited company determine that it is in the
best interests of the company to issue shares for cash, the company must first offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders of the company on a pro-rata basis (commonly referred to as the statutory pre-emption
right) unless the directors opt out of - i.e., &#147;dis-apply&#148; - the statutory pre-emption right under an authority conferred by the constitution of the company or approved by shareholders. Companies incorporated in the U.S. are not subject to
similar share issuance restrictions.<B><I> </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Why we are incorporated in Ireland and listed in the U.S. </I></B>Prothena was
formerly substantially all of the drug discovery business of Elan Corporation, plc (&#147;Elan&#148;), an Irish public limited company formed in 1969. In connection with the planned separation of that business from Elan - in what is commonly
referred to as a &#147;spin off&#148; transaction - Prothena was formed on September&nbsp;26, 2012 under the laws of Ireland. Elan&#146;s drug discovery business was then distributed to Prothena on December&nbsp;20, 2012, and Prothena commenced
trading the next day on The NASDAQ Global Market. Both Elan and Prothena were at all times Irish companies, i.e., neither became an Irish company through an &#147;inversion&#148; transaction. In preparing for becoming a separate publicly-traded
company, Prothena&#146;s management and Board of Directors determined to list its shares only on The NASDAQ Global Market based on their assessment that it would provide the best access to the capital Prothena would require in order to advance the
development of its product candidates and otherwise achieve its strategic goals.<B><I> </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our current share issuance
authorities. </I></B>When it formed on September&nbsp;26, 2012, Prothena&#146;s initial Articles of Association (now referred to as its Constitution) authorized our Board of Directors to allot and issue shares up to a maximum of our authorized but
unissued share capital and to opt out of the statutory pre-emption right.&nbsp;Accordingly, subject to NASDAQ and SEC rules and regulations, our Board is currently authorized to issue shares, without shareholder approval, up to a maximum of our
authorized but unissued share capital, and is further authorized to issue those shares for cash without first being required to offer those shares to all of our shareholders on a pro-rata basis.&nbsp;In this Proxy Statement, we refer to our
Board&#146;s authority to allot and issue shares and our Board&#146;s authority to opt out of the statutory pre-emption right collectively as our share issuance authorities.&nbsp;Our current share issuance authorities have, since Prothena was first
formed, kept us on an equal footing with our peer companies who are incorporated and listed in the U.S.&nbsp;However, our current share issuance authorities will expire on September&nbsp;26, 2017 unless renewed by our shareholders.<B><I>
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Renewal of our current share issuance authorities will allow us to continue to execute on our business and growth strategy
without competitive disadvantage</I></B>. Proposal Nos. 5 and 6 ask our shareholders to renew, for another five years, the same share issuance authorities that have been in place and that we have been operating under since Prothena was formed.
Approval of these proposals would extend - but would <B><I></I></B><I>not </I><B><I></I></B>expand - the current share issuance authorities of our Board. We are and will continue to be subject to all of the shareholder approval and other
requirements that arise from our ordinary shares being listed exclusively on The NASDAQ Global Select Market and from Prothena being considered a U.S. domestic reporting company under SEC rules. Our Board will also continue to focus on and satisfy
its fiduciary duties to our shareholders with respect to share issuances.<B><I> </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many of the companies with which we compete
strategically and for capital are incorporated in the U.S., and are therefore not subject to similar share issuance restrictions.&nbsp;We are asking you to approve Proposal Nos. 5 and 6 to allow us to continue to execute on our business and growth
strategy in a timely and competitive manner. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="tx296767_31"></A>Effect on Authorized Ordinary Shares </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Of the 100,000,000 ordinary shares that we currently have authorized for issuance, as of the close of business on March&nbsp;13, 2017, there
were 37,940,930 ordinary shares outstanding and another 5,860,331 ordinary shares reserved for issuance under our shareholder-approved equity compensation plan (the Amended and Restated 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan). Renewal of the current share
issuance authorities will <I>not</I> increase the number of our authorized ordinary shares or otherwise provide greater authority than is currently provided for under our Constitution, other than to renew the term of the share issuance authorities
for an additional five years. In addition, although at present our Board has no immediate plans, arrangements or understandings with respect to any share issuances for which renewal of the share issuance authorities is necessary, other than
issuances of shares under our shareholder-approved equity compensation plan, our Board desires to retain the flexibility afforded by the current share issuance authorities in order to allow us to continue to be in a position to act quickly with
respect to financing opportunities to further our development programs. </P>  <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>S<A NAME="tx296767_32"></A>pecific Rationale for Proposing to Renew Our
Current Share Issuance Authorities </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We need the ability to execute on our business and growth strategy without competitive
disadvantage</I></B>. The renewal of our Board&#146;s share issuance authorities is fundamental to the way we intend to advance our business and increase shareholder value. As further described below, our growth strategy depends on our ability to
research, develop and commercialize our product candidates, which requires significant capital. Our Board and management rely heavily on having the flexibility to quickly take advantage of opportunities to raise capital through share issuances for
cash. If Proposal No.&nbsp;5 is not approved, we would be required to obtain shareholder approval prior to issuing any shares after September&nbsp;26, 2017, even if we would not otherwise be required to obtain shareholder approval under NASDAQ
rules. Similarly, even if Proposal No.&nbsp;5 is approved, if Proposal No.&nbsp;6 is not also approved, in each case where we propose to issue shares for cash consideration after September&nbsp;26, 2017, we would first have to offer those shares on
the same or more favorable terms to all of our existing shareholders. These limitations, in either case, would put us at a distinct disadvantage in effectively and efficiently raising capital, and in competing for capital vis-&agrave;-vis many of
our peers because many of the companies with which we compete strategically and for capital are incorporated in the U.S., and are therefore not subject to similar share issuance restrictions. These limitations would make it more difficult and costly
for us to complete capital raising transactions in furtherance of our growth strategy, thus potentially limiting our ability to raise the capital necessary to execute on the strategy that we believe is in the best interests of our
shareholders.<B><I> </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we would still retain the ability to seek shareholder approval in connection with a specific issuance
of shares should our shareholders not approve Proposal Nos. 5 and 6, we do not believe that convening an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to approve each specific share issuance (and the corresponding dis-application of the statutory
pre-emption right) we seek to undertake would be a workable alternative to obtaining approval of Proposal Nos. 5 and 6. The uncertainty of whether we could obtain such shareholder approval in the context of a specific issuance, as well as the delays
we would experience in seeking such approval, would preclude us from taking advantage of opportunistic market windows and could preclude our ability to raise capital altogether. A case-by-case shareholder approval approach ignores market dynamics
and competitive realities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Likewise, even if Proposal No.&nbsp;5 is approved, if Proposal No.&nbsp;6 is not also approved, in any
capital raising transaction where we propose to issue shares for cash consideration, we would be required to first offer those shares that we propose to issue for cash to all of our existing shareholders in a time-consuming pro-rata rights offering,
which would disadvantage us vis-&agrave;-vis many of our peers in competing for capital, would significantly encumber the capital-raising process, would significantly increase our costs, and would significantly increase the timetable for completing
such a cash financing transaction, thus potentially limiting our ability to advance the development of our product candidates and otherwise achieve strategic goals that we believe are in the best interests of our shareholders. </I></B></P>

substantially all of our efforts on the development and clinical testing of our product candidates, which efforts require significant capital.<B><I> </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our proposal to renew our share issuance authorities for five years is directly tied to our specific growth strategy.</I></B> As a
clinical stage company, we rely heavily on, and until such time that we successfully obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and achieve substantial positive cash flows from the commercialization of any approved drug candidates, will
continue to rely heavily on, access to the capital markets in order to fund our operations. Likewise, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, the amounts of
increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the development of our product candidates are inherently uncertain, as is the time horizon for which we expect to rely principally on access to the capital markets to fund
the completion of our product candidate development efforts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Specifically, our future capital requirements will depend on numerous
factors, including, without limitation, the timing of initiation, progress, results and costs of our clinical trials; the results of our research and preclinical studies; the costs of clinical manufacturing and of establishing commercial
manufacturing arrangements; the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; the costs and timing of capital asset purchases; our ability to establish
research collaborations, strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements; the costs to satisfy our obligations under current and potential future collaborations; and the timing, receipt, and amount of revenues or royalties, if any, from
any approved drug candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that renewing our current share issuance authorities for an additional five years is in the best
interests of our shareholders because renewal of the share issuance authorities provides our Board the flexibility, consistent with its fiduciary duties and subject always to the shareholder approval and other requirements of NASDAQ and the SEC, to
efficiently and cost-effectively access the capital markets without the competitive disadvantage and risks associated with seeking deal-specific shareholder approvals. As noted above, we do not believe that convening an extraordinary general meeting
of shareholders to approve each specific share issuance we seek to undertake would be a workable alternative to obtaining approval of Proposal Nos. 5 and 6. In addition, we believe that renewing our current share issuance authorities for an
additional five years instead of seeking general re-approval of our share issuance authorities on a more frequent basis is in the best interests of our shareholders because seeking general re-approval of our share issuance authorities on a more
frequent basis would still subject us to the competitive disadvantage risk, particularly given the 75% vote threshold required to dis-apply the statutory pre-emption right. Our concern in this regard is that a single shareholder or small number of
shareholders, including those with a short-term focus, could defeat a proposal to disapply the statutory pre-emption right given the high vote threshold to approve that dis-application, even if a substantial majority of our shareholders who are
supportive of our business and long-term growth strategy vote to approve the dis-application of the statutory pre-emption right. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We
do not believe that limitations derived from Irish capital market practice should apply to Prothena</I></B><B>.&nbsp;</B><B><I></I></B>While not required by Irish law, we understand that it has become market practice for companies whose share
capital is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange (the &#147;ISE&#148;) to generally limit the share allotment and issuance authority to an amount equal to 33% of their issued share capital for a period of 12 to 18 months and to generally limit the
dis-application of the statutory pre-emption right to only 5% of their issued share capital for a period of 12 to 18 months.&nbsp;While these limitations in size and duration on share issuance authorities are part of the corporate governance
framework applicable to companies whose share capital is listed on the ISE (regardless of whether such companies are incorporated in Ireland or elsewhere), our shares are not, and never have been, listed on the ISE, and we are not subject to ISE
share listing rules or corporate governance standards applicable to companies whose share capital is listed on the ISE.<B><I> </I></B></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are required to seek shareholder approval to renew our current share issuance authorities
because we are incorporated in Ireland. However, the U.S. capital markets are the sole capital markets for our ordinary shares and our ordinary shares are listed solely on The NASDAQ Global Select Market. As such, we believe that our shareholders
expect us to, and we are committed to, follow customary U.S. capital markets practices, U.S. corporate governance standards and NASDAQ and SEC rules and regulations. We also believe that applying the standards and market practices of a market where
our shares are not listed would be inappropriate and not in the best interests of our Company or our shareholders, especially in circumstances where we are committed to complying with the governance rules and practices of the actual capital market
for our shares - The NASDAQ Global Select Market - which imposes its own restrictions on share issuances for the protection of shareholders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We understand that certain proxy advisory firms have in recent proxy seasons applied their United Kingdom (&#147;U.K.&#148;) and Ireland
voting guidelines in formulating their voting recommendations on share issuance authorities proposals for Irish-incorporated U.S.-listed companies, meaning that they have applied or otherwise taken into account the market practice for companies
whose share capital is listed on the ISE in formulating their voting recommendations on share issuance authorities proposals for Irish-incorporated companies, even if their shares are not listed on the ISE (or any U.K. exchange).&nbsp;For all of the
reasons discussed above and below, we respectfully disagree with this approach. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also understand that some Irish-incorporated companies

executing on our long-term business plan and growth strategy, while also creating value for our shareholders. We have been deliberately disciplined in deploying our cash and raising additional capital. Our cash management and what we believe to be
well-timed and -executed share issuances that have successfully raised critically-needed capital to further our development programs speak to our commitment to deploy and raise capital wisely and in the best interests of our shareholders. As
discussed above, we do not have any products approved for commercial sale, and in order to develop and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates we will need to raise substantial additional capital. It is therefore critical that we have
the ability to efficiently and cost-effectively access the capital markets, including by capitalizing on what can be narrow opportunistic market windows and avoiding unnecessary costs, delays and uncertainties.<B><I> </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Risks if our current share issuance authorities are not renewed. </I></B>For all of the foregoing reasons, we believe that the
additional restrictions on our ability to raise capital if our share issuance authorities are not renewed would negatively impact our ability to execute on our business and growth strategy. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive industry,
and believe that the failure to renew our current share issuance authorities would put us at a competitive disadvantage; conversely, we believe that the renewal of our current share issuance authorities, as proposed, would keep us on an equal
footing with our peer companies who are incorporated and listed in the U.S.<B><I> </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We believe that these typical Irish stock
exchange limitations would disadvantage us relative to our U.S.-incorporated U.S.-listed peers.</I></B> Companies that are incorporated and exchange-listed in the U.S. are not generally required to - and therefore do not - seek shareholder approval
to renew their authority to allot and issue shares or to opt out of the statutory pre-emption right. In this regard, companies that are incorporated and publicly-traded in the U.S. generally do not grant all of their shareholders pre-emptive rights
on new issuances of shares for cash. Instead, U.S. investors generally appear to accept that companies often need to access capital markets quickly, and that potential concerns associated with affording management flexibility in this respect are
adequately protected against by other factors, including the shareholder approval requirements of U.S. exchanges with respect to share issuances.<B><I> </I></B></P>

U.S.-incorporated companies listed on the NASDAQ. For example, NASDAQ rules generally require shareholder approval prior to our issuing shares at a discount in connection with a transaction other than a public offering where the number of shares to
be issued is or will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares outstanding before the issuance.&nbsp;Likewise, shareholder approval is required under the NASDAQ rules prior to our issuing shares when the issuance would
result in a change of control of the Company (which would generally be deemed to occur under NASDAQ rules if a share issuance transaction results in an investor or group of investors obtaining a 20% or greater ownership position in our Company on a
post-transaction basis, and that ownership position would be the largest position in the Company). Moreover, with limited exceptions, our Board must also seek shareholder approval of equity compensation plans, including material revisions of such
plans.<B><I> </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our shareholders are supportive of our business and growth strategy that drives our proposal to renew our

the views of institutional investors representing approximately 77% of our outstanding shares. These discussions have been productive and informative, and have helped ensure that our Board&#146;s decisions are aligned with shareholder objectives.
During these discussions, our shareholders have generally been supportive of our business and growth strategy. In discussions we have had with shareholders about the share issuance authorities that must be renewed as a matter of Irish law,
shareholders have generally understood that renewing our existing share issuance authorities would allow us to continue to execute on our business and growth strategy in a timely and competitive manner. </P>

2016, the Committee received Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s report on the Company&#146;s performance relative to the pre-determined corporate objectives for 2016, as well as on the individual performance of each executive officer other than himself. The
Company&#146;s Vice President, Human Resources (who is not an executive officer) participated in that Committee meeting, as did the lead Radford consultant. After receiving that report, the Committee determined the annual cash bonus to be paid to

present, the lead Radford consultant and the Vice President, Human Resources, to discuss Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s compensation. The Committee determined its recommendation to the full Board (other than Dr.&nbsp;Kinney) on Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s annual
cash bonus for 2016. In an executive session without Dr.&nbsp;Kinney present, the Board approved that bonus recommended by the Committee. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Executive
Compensation for Fiscal Year 2016 </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The three key elements of our executive officer compensation programs for fiscal year 2016 were:
base salaries; annual cash bonuses; and long-term incentive compensation in the form of annual stock option awards. In addition, the Committee (or the Board) has approved arrangements providing for certain payments and benefits in the event of
certain terminations of employment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Base Salaries.</I></B>&nbsp;Base salaries are intended to compensate our executive officers for
serving as the senior members of our executive team. Salaries are also considered an important element of compensation necessary to retain the Company&#146;s executive officers in a competitive marketplace. To accomplish these objectives, the
Committee reviews and sets base salaries annually, generally - but not always - positioning around the 50<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the market data specific to each executive officer&#146;s position, which
the Committee considers appropriate to accomplish the purposes of this element of executive compensation.<B><I> </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In determining
base salaries for fiscal year 2016 at the beginning of that fiscal year, the Committee considered the market data provided by Radford, and also made subjective assessments of each executive officer&#146;s experience, performance and criticality.
Based on these considerations, the Committee approved adjustments to annual base salaries of our named executive officers (other than Dr.&nbsp;Schenk) in the range of 3.0% to 6.7%, in order to maintain them at approximately the 50<SUP

salary when he was promoted to COO and recommending to the Board his base salary when he was promoted to CEO. The Committee approved a base salary increase from $400,000 to $450,000 (a 12.5% adjustment) when Dr.&nbsp;Kinney was promoted to COO in
August 2016, which was slightly above the 75<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the market data for that position (using the 2017 peer group). The Committee deemed this adjustment appropriate given
Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s increased responsibilities and his existing base salary relative to that of the other named executive officers. The Committee recommended and the Board approved a base salary increase from $450,000 to $500,000 (a 11.1%
adjustment) when Dr.&nbsp;Kinney was promoted to CEO in September 2016, which was below the 25<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the market data for that position (using the 2017 peer group), and which the
Committee and the Board deemed appropriate given that they would be conducting a reassessment of executive compensation programs, including its annual review of Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s and the other named executive officers&#146; compensation only a
few months later in early fiscal year 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Committee approved Ms.&nbsp;Karp&#146;s base salary of $400,000 in connection with her
commencement of employment as the Company&#146;s Chief Regulatory Officer in December 2016, following the Committee&#146;s review of market data for that position and negotiations with Ms.&nbsp;Karp. This base salary was at around the 75<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the market data (using the 2017 peer group), which the Committee deemed appropriate given that her compensation was being set near the end of 2016 and therefore would not be reviewed

principally to motivate executive officers to achieve pre-determined annual operational and financial (&#147;corporate&#148;) objectives set by the Committee to promote achievement of our business strategies and drive increases in shareholder value.
The annual cash bonuses for our executive officers other than the CEO depend primarily on the Company&#146;s achievement of those corporate objectives, but also depend on individual performance. Our CEO&#146;s annual cash bonus depends exclusively
on the Company&#146;s achievement of the pre-determined corporate objectives. The Committee believes that broader corporate objectives are appropriate to ensure all executive officers are working together toward those goals, and that individual
performance is in some cases an appropriate additional consideration to motivate and reward individual contributions to the Company&#146;s overall success. These cash awards are made under our Incentive Compensation Plan (the &#147;ICP&#148;), and
are described the <B><I></I></B><I>Grants of Plan-Based Awards - Fiscal Year 2016</I><B><I></I></B> table below.<B><I> </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
determining the targeted annual cash bonus opportunity for each named executive officer at the beginning of 2016, the Committee considered Radford&#146;s market data on targeted annual cash bonus opportunity and total targeted annual cash
compensation. The Committee also considered the experience, performance and criticality of each executive officer. Based on these considerations, the Committee determined each executive officer&#146;s targeted annual cash bonus opportunity, which
were generally around the 75<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the market data for comparable positions, although the Committee did not necessarily target the
75<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile. Because the Committee set base salaries that were generally around the 50<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile, the resulting total targeted annual
cash compensation for each executive officer generally fell in the range of the 50<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> to 75<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentiles. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Targeted annual cash bonuses are expressed as a percentage of annual base salary. At the beginning of fiscal year 2016, the Committee
recommended and the Board approved setting Dr.&nbsp;Schenk&#146;s targeted cash bonus at 60% of his base salary earned in 2016, and the Committee set the other named executive officers&#146; targeted cash bonuses at 40% of their respective base
salaries earned in 2016 (other than Ms.&nbsp;Karp, who joined the Company in December 2016 and therefore was not eligible for a cash bonus for 2016). The maximum cash bonus that could have been earned by the named executive officers was 150% of

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s targeted cash bonus was set at 40% of his base salary when he was our CSO. The Committee increased this to 50% of
Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s base salary when he was promoted to COO in August 2016, which was at around the 50<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the market data (using the 2017 peer group), which the Committee deemed
appropriate in light of Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s additional responsibilities and internal equity considerations, as discussed above. The Committee recommended and the Board approved a further increase in this target annual bonus to 60% of base salary
when Dr.&nbsp;Kinney was promoted to CEO in September 2016, which was at around the 75<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the market data (using the 2017 peer group) for that position. These adjustments were
pro-rated for the periods Dr.&nbsp;Kinney served in these respective positions, which resulted in a targeted cash bonus for 2016 of 47% of his base salary earned in 2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dr.&nbsp;Schenk&#146;s annual cash bonus for fiscal year 2016 depended 100% on the Company&#146;s performance relative to pre-determined

and 25% on their respective individual performance, as determined by the Committee based on assessments from the CEO and the Committee&#146;s knowledge of individual performance. Initially, Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s annual cash bonus for fiscal year
2016 was to depend 75% on those corporate objectives and 25% on his individual performance, but the Committee recommended and the Board approved in connection with his promotion to CEO that, like Dr.&nbsp;Schenk, his annual cash bonus for fiscal

performance relative to the pre-determined corporate objectives was achieved at 105%. Based on Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s assessment and report to the Committee on each other named executive officer&#146;s individual performance (relative to the
pre-determined corporate objectives and/or more generally), the Committee approved annual cash bonuses to the named executive officers (other than Dr.&nbsp;Kinney) ranging from 104% to 105% of their targeted annual cash bonuses. The Committee
recommended to the Board that Dr.&nbsp;Schenk&#146;s and Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s annual cash bonuses be 105% of their targeted annual performance-based bonuses - consistent with what the Committee determined with respect the Company&#146;s
achievement relative to the pre-determined corporate objectives - which recommendations the Board approved. Dr.&nbsp;Schenk&#146;s bonus was pro-rated for the period prior to his death (and was paid to his estate). The actual annual cash bonus paid

Committee uses primarily to motivate our executive officers to increase shareholder value, and secondarily to retain executive officers. The Committee believes that long-term incentive compensation also encourages our executive officers to identify,
pursue and invest in appropriate long-term strategies for increasing shareholder value. Our long-term incentives for fiscal year 2016 were solely in the form of nonqualified stock (share) options awarded under our shareholder-approved Amended and
Restated 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan (the &#147;LTIP&#148;).<B><I> </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We use stock options to link executive officer compensation
directly to increases in the price of our ordinary shares, which directly reflects increased shareholder value. All stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value (as defined by our LTIP) of our ordinary shares on
the date of grant, and generally require continued employment for four years in order to vest fully. Stock options therefore compensate our executive officers only if our share price increases after the date of grant and the executive officer
remains employed for the periods required for the stock option to become exercisable. The Committee thus considers stock options a particularly effective incentive and retention tool because it motivates our executive officers to increase
shareholder value and remain with the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In determining the annual stock option to award to each named executive officer (and to

executive officer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on these considerations, the Committee approved annual stock option awards in February 2016 to each of our named
executive officers (other than Ms.&nbsp;Karp, who joined the Company in December 2016). The grant date Black-Scholes values of these stock options were generally between the 50<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> and 75<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentiles of the market data, although the Committee did not specifically target the 50<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> to

50,000 shares) to Dr.&nbsp;Kinney in connection with his promotion to COO in August 2016, and the Committee recommended to the Board, which the Board approved, another stock option award (for 30,000 shares) to Dr.&nbsp;Kinney in connection with his
promotion to CEO in September 2016. Each of these stock options vests as to 25% of the shares subject to the option on the first anniversary of the applicable date of promotion, and as to 1/48<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP>
of the options on each monthly anniversary thereafter, subject to Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s continued employment on each applicable vesting date. In determining the size of each of these additional stock option awards, the Committee considered the size
and Black-Scholes value of the stock options already awarded to Dr.&nbsp;Kinney in 2016, and how the aggregate Black-Scholes value of those awards compared to the market data (using the 2017 peer group) for Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s new position. The
grant date Black-Scholes value of the stock option awarded to Dr.&nbsp;Kinney in connection with his promotion to COO, put his total stock option awards in 2016 at around the 75<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of
the market data, which the Committee deemed appropriate given Dr.&nbsp;Kinney&#146;s increased responsibilities and how his stock option awards in 2016 compared to awards to the other named executive officers. The grant date Black-Scholes value of
the stock option awarded to Dr.&nbsp;Kinney in connection with his promotion to CEO put his total stock option awards in 2016 at around the 50<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the market data, which the Committee
and Board deemed appropriate given that they would be conducting a reassessment of executive compensation programs and considering an annual stock option award for Dr.&nbsp;Kinney only a few months later in early fiscal year 2017. </P>

monthly anniversary thereafter, subject to Ms.&nbsp;Karp&#146;s continued employment on each applicable vesting date. In determining the size of that stock option award, the Committee considered the market data as well as the size of stock option
awards to previous newly-hired senior executive officers and decided it was appropriate to award a stock option to Ms.&nbsp;Karp in line with those previous awards. The Committee also deemed the size of her award appropriate given that her
compensation was being set near the end of 2016 and therefore would not be reviewed and considered for another stock option award until early in fiscal year 2018. </P>

transaction, arrangement or relationship, or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which the Company was, is or will be a participant, where the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related person had, has or will have
a direct or indirect material interest. A related person is (a)&nbsp;any director (or nominee for director) or executive officer of the Company, (b)&nbsp;any beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company&#146;s ordinary shares, or (c)&nbsp;certain

Audit Committee, (b)&nbsp;if the Related Party Transaction relates to compensation of a director or executive officer, it must be reviewed and approved or ratified by the Compensation Committee of our Board, and (c)&nbsp;the Board may approve or
ratify a Related Party Transaction by an affirmative vote of a majority of directors who do not have an director indirect material interest in the Related Party Transaction. Prior to approval or ratification of a proposed Related Party Transaction,
the Audit Committee considers all relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, the financial and others terms and whether such terms, taken as a whole, are no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained in an arms-length

plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor
of the Company; provided, however, that the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or make other arrangements to meet the Company&#146;s obligations under the Plan to deliver cash, Shares, other Awards, or other property pursuant to any
Award, which trusts or other arrangements shall be consistent with the &#147;unfunded&#148; status of the Plan unless the Committee otherwise determines with the consent of each affected Participant. </P>

approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of options and other awards otherwise than under the
Plan, and such arrangements may be either applicable generally or only in specific cases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(h) <I>Not Compensation for Benefit Plans.
</I>No Award payable under this Plan shall be deemed salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any benefit plan or other arrangement of the Company for the benefit of its employees, consultants or directors unless the
Company shall determine otherwise. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(i) <I>No Fractional Shares. </I>No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the
Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash, other Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise
eliminated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(j) <I>Employees Subject to Taxation outside the United States. </I>With respect to Participants who are subject to taxation
in countries other than the United States, the Committee may make Awards on such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate to comply with the laws of the applicable countries, and the Committee may create such procedures, addenda and
subplans and make such modifications as may be necessary or advisable to comply with such laws. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(k) <I>Company Policies</I>. All Awards
granted under the Plan shall be subject to any applicable clawback or recoupment policies, share trading policies and other policies that may be implemented by the Board from time to time. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(l) <I>Governing Law. </I>The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan, any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and any Award
Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of Ireland, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws thereof. </P>

approved by the Board, subject to approval of the Plan by the Company&#146;s stockholders (the &#147;<I>Effective Date</I>&#148;). No Awards may be granted or awarded during any period of suspension or after termination of the Plan, and in no event
may any Incentive Stock Option be granted under the Plan after the tenth (10<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP>)&nbsp;anniversary of the Effective Date. </P>

under the Plan upon an event and in a manner permitted by section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if required by section 409A of the Code, if a Participant is considered a
&#147;specified employee&#148; for purposes of section 409A and if payment of any Award under this Plan is required to be delayed for a period of six months after &#147;separation from service&#148; within the meaning of section 409A of the Code,
payment of such Award shall be delayed as required by section 409A, and the accumulated amounts with respect to such Award shall be paid in a lump sum payment within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the end of the six (6)&nbsp;month period. If the

the Plan would cause a conflict with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, or would cause the administration of the Plan to fail to satisfy the requirements of section 409A, such provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent
permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, each Participant shall be solely responsible for the tax consequences of Awards under the Plan, and in no event shall the Company have any
responsibility or liability if an Award does not meet any applicable requirements of section 409A of the Code. Although the Company intends to administer the Plan to prevent taxation under section 409A of the Code, the Company does not represent or
