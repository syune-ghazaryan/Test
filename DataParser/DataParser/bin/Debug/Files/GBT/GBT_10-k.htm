biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics to treat grievous blood-based disorders with significant unmet need. Our lead product candidate is GBT440, an oral, once-daily therapy that
modulates hemoglobin&#146;s affinity for oxygen, which we believe inhibits hemoglobin polymerization in sickle cell disease, or SCD, and improves hypoxemia in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. We are developing GBT440 for SCD. We are currently
evaluating GBT440 in SCD in a Phase 3 clinical trial of GBT440 in adult and adolescent patients with SCD. In addition, we are evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of GBT440 in a Phase 2a clinical trial of
adolescent patients with SCD. In December 2015, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation for GBT440 for the treatment of SCD, and in November 2016 we were granted Orphan Drug Designation in
Europe for GBT440 for the treatment of SCD. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to SCD, we are conducting two Phase 2 clinical trials of GBT440 for the potential
treatment of IPF, which is a hypoxemic pulmonary disorder. We are also engaged in other pre-clinical research and development activities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SCD is marked by red blood cell, or RBC, destruction and occluded blood flow and hypoxia, leading to anemia, stroke, multi-organ failure,
severe pain crises, and shortened patient life span. GBT440 inhibits abnormal hemoglobin polymerization, the underlying mechanism that causes sickling of RBCs. In our clinical trials of GBT440 in SCD patients, we observed reduced markers of RBC
destruction, improvements in anemia, improvements in markers of tissue oxygenation, and reduced numbers of sickled RBCs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SCD is a genetic
blood disorder caused by a single point mutation in the beta-chain of hemoglobin, which results in the formation of abnormal hemoglobin known as sickle hemoglobin, or HbS. Normally, oxygenated RBCs travel from the lung through blood vessels.
Hemoglobin is the protein inside RBCs that carries oxygen and releases oxygen at the tissues. In SCD, when oxygen is released, HbS becomes sticky and aggregates into polymers, or long, rigid rods within RBC, much like a &#147;sword within a
balloon.&#148; The RBCs assume a sickled shape and becomes inflexible, which can destroy RBCs, cause blockage in small blood vessels, block blood flow, and decrease oxygen delivery to tissues. As a result, beginning in early childhood, SCD patients
suffer many clinical consequences, including unpredictable and recurrent episodes, or crises, of severe chronic and acute pain, anemia, stroke, spleen failure, pulmonary hypertension, acute chest syndrome, liver disease, kidney failure, other
morbidities, and premature death. These consequences are directly related to reduced blood flow and insufficient oxygen delivery. According to a 2014 publication, in the United States, SCD shortens patient life expectancy by approximately 25 to 30
years even with available medical care. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Current treatment options for SCD are limited to one approved therapy for adults known as
hydroxyurea, blood transfusions and bone marrow transplantation. The utilization of these treatments is significantly limited due to their suboptimal efficacy and significant toxicity. As a result, patients with SCD continue to suffer serious
morbidity and premature mortality. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for a novel SCD therapy that: </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
inherently increased oxygen affinity that allows a fetus to extract oxygen from the mother&#146;s blood.&nbsp;Typically, newborns with SCD do not experience RBC sickling until approximately six
to nine months of age, after which HbF is usually no longer expressed.&nbsp;Additionally, it has been observed that rare individuals who have inherited both the HbS mutation as well as a gene deletion that allows them to continue to express 10% to
30% HbF in their RBCs into adulthood do not exhibit the clinical manifestations of SCD, despite expressing up to 90% sickled hemoglobin, or HbS in their blood. HbF dilutes the concentration of deoxygenated HbS that can participate in hemoglobin
polymerization, and thereby significantly reduces the formation of hemoglobin polymers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">GBT440 is a novel, proprietary investigational
drug that increases hemoglobin&#146;s affinity for oxygen by binding to the alpha-chain of hemoglobin. GBT440 has been observed to keep a proportion of HbS, in its oxygenated state, where it cannot participate in polymerization.&nbsp;Similar to HbF,
by diluting total HbS with a proportion of GBT440-bound hemoglobin, GBT440 prevents hemoglobin polymer formation. Based on its mechanism of action, we believe that GBT440 can reduce the physical and clinical manifestations of SCD. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2014, we initiated our randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single and multiple ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical study of
GBT440 in healthy subjects and patients with SCD. The study was conducted in three parts: single dose administration, followed by multiple dose administration, daily for 15 days in healthy subjects and 28 days in SCD subjects, and then followed by
multiple dose administration, daily for up to six months in SCD subjects. In this clinical trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GBT440, as well as exploratory markers of SCD activity, including
anti-hemolytic effects and SCD-related clinical effects. We reported initial results from this clinical trial at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, meeting in December 2015. We reported additional results from this clinical trial at the
European Hematological Association meeting in June 2016 and at the ASH meeting in December 2016. Among the 41 SCD subjects who received multiple doses of GBT440 (at doses of either 1000mg, 900mg, 700mg or 500mg&nbsp;per day) for 28 days up to six
months, 100% of study subjects demonstrated a hematologic response to GBT440 therapy, as evidenced by improvements in one or more markers of hemolysis and anemia (hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin and percentage reticulocyte counts). In addition,
all study cohorts showed marked reductions in irreversibly sickled cells in the peripheral blood from baseline, and, all study subjects treated for 90 days to up to six months showed sustained improvement in bilirubin and percentage reticulocyte
counts, continued reductions in sickled RBCs and a median 1.0 g/dL increase in hemoglobin. As a result, this Phase 1/2 clinical study demonstrated GBT440&#146;s pharmacological mechanism of action and linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In
this clinical study, GBT440 was well tolerated through six months of dosing; the most common treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate headaches and gastrointestinal disorders, which occurred in similar rates in the placebo arms. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following discussions with the FDA that concluded successfully in October 2016, we have initiated a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multi-national Phase 3 clinical trial of GBT440 in SCD that we refer to as the HOPE study. The HOPE study is designed to enroll up to 400 adult and adolescent SCD patients, age 12 years and older, who have had at least one
episode of vaso-occlusive crisis in the previous year. The HOPE study is being conducted in two parts: the initial Part A, which will compare two dose levels of GBT440 (900 mg and 1500 mg) versus placebo, and will include up to 150 patients;
followed by Part B, which will include 250 patients randomized to placebo or a dose of GBT440 selected based on the results of Part A. The main objectives of Part A are to select the optimal dose, define the final secondary endpoints for Part B and
qualify the Patient Reported Outcome, or PRO, instrument. The primary efficacy endpoint of the HOPE study is the proportion of patients who achieve a &gt;1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin at 24 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. Key secondary
efficacy endpoints include the effect of GBT440 on SCD symptom exacerbation, which will be measured by our PRO instrument, in addition to overall SCD symptoms as compared to placebo. We will also assess traditionally defined vaso-occlusive crisis as
well as hospitalizations and red blood cell transfusions as secondary endpoints. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe there is a significant market opportunity in

lungs. The cause of IPF is unknown and there is no cure. As an IPF patient&#146;s lung scarring worsens, the lungs cannot properly transport oxygen into the bloodstream and, as a result, the body&#146;s tissues do not get the oxygen they need.
Progression of lung scarring inevitably results in hypoxemia causing shortness of breath, and a decline in overall function; eventually the use of supplemental oxygen is necessary. Ultimately, the progressive worsening of lung function over time
leads to organ dysfunction, frequent hospitalizations and death. IPF typically affects individuals over the age of 50, and the median survival after diagnosis is approximately 2 to 3 years. </P>

patients&#146; symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue, and contributes to adverse patient outcomes. GBT440 has been shown to increase oxygen saturation in animal models of pulmonary fibrosis and severe hypoxemia. Based on these findings, GBT is now
conducting two clinical trials of GBT440 as a potential treatment for hypoxemia in a broad range of subjects with IPF. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2016, we

IPF who have hypoxemia on exertion. In November 2016, we initiated our second Phase 2a clinical trial of GBT440 in IPF, an open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GBT440 for the treatment of hypoxemia in IPF patients who are
using supplemental oxygen at rest. We have named this second Phase 2a clinical study the ZEPHYR study. In addition, in February 2017, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the physiologic effects of GBT440 in healthy volunteers under

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SCD is a grievous disease that can lead to hemolytic anemia, meaning the destruction of RBCs within blood vessels, and vaso-occlusion, which
means blocked blood flow to tissues, as well as progressive multi-organ damage and early death. Beginning in childhood, patients suffer unpredictable and recurrent episodes or crises of severe pain due to blocked blood flow to organs, which often
lead to physical and psychosocial disability. In addition, the constant destruction of RBCs with the release of their contents into the blood often leads to damaged or diseased blood vessels, which further exacerbate blood flow obstruction and
multi-organ damage. Consequences of SCD can manifest in early childhood and may include stroke, spleen failure, pulmonary hypertension, acute chest syndrome, liver disease, kidney failure, leg ulcers, priapism, which is a medical emergency due to
refractory penile erection, and premature death. According to a 2014 publication, in the United States, SCD shortens patient life expectancy by approximately 25 to 30 years even with available medical care. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SCD is a genetic blood disorder caused by a single gene mutation in the beta-chain of hemoglobin, which results in mutant hemoglobin known as
HbS. Hemoglobin is the protein in RBCs that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body&#146;s tissues, releases oxygen at the tissues, and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Hemoglobin accomplishes this by binding and then
releasing oxygen through allosterism, which means the </P>

hemoglobin molecule changes its shape to have a high affinity for oxygen in the lungs, where oxygen is abundant, and to have a low affinity for oxygen in the tissues, where oxygen must be
released. Oxyhemoglobin, the high oxygen affinity form of hemoglobin, is formed in the lungs during respiration, when oxygen binds to the hemoglobin molecule. Deoxyhemoglobin, the low oxygen affinity form of hemoglobin, is formed when oxygen
molecules are removed from the binding site as blood flows from the lungs to the tissues in the body. In patients with SCD, deoxygenated HbS, molecules polymerize to form long, rigid rods within an RBC, much like a &#147;sword within a
balloon.&#148; As a consequence, the normally round and flexible RBC becomes rigid and elongate into a &#147;sickled&#148; shape. Sickled RBCs do not flow properly in the bloodstream; they clog small blood vessels and reduce blood flow to the
organs. This results in inadequate oxygen delivery, or hypoxia, to all body tissues, which can lead to multi-organ failure and premature death. </P>

chemotherapy drug, was approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of sickle cell anemia in adults with 3 or more painful crises per year. Hydroxyurea is currently the only drug approved for SCD, and it is not approved for pediatric SCD patients
in the United States. The use of hydroxyurea is significantly limited by its side effect profile, variable patient responses and concerns regarding long-term toxicity. Hydroxyurea&#146;s side effects include impairment of fertility, suppression of
white blood cells, or neutropenia, and suppression of platelets, or thrombocytopenia, which place patients at risk for infection and bleeding. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to hydroxyurea treatment, transfusions with normal blood are an option to help alleviate anemia, which is a common symptom of SCD,
and reduce sickling of RBCs. Blood transfusions have a number of limitations, including the expense of treatment, lack of uniform accessibility and risks ranging from allergic reactions to serious complications such as blood-borne infection and iron
overload, which can cause organ damage. The only potentially curative treatment currently available for SCD patients is bone marrow transplantation, which requires a suitable matching donor and carries significant risks, including an approximately
5% mortality rate. Despite the current standard of care, including hydroxyurea, blood transfusion and palliative therapy for acute pain attacks, patients with SCD continue to suffer serious morbidity and premature mortality. </P>

bind to hemoglobin, resulting in increased oxygen affinity. The effect of GBT440 on the measured OEC is a shift of the curve to the left on the horizontal axis, as shown in the graph below. In other words, at a given prevailing oxygen tension in the

 </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In various studies of SCD, scientists have demonstrated that hemoglobin in the oxygenated state is a potent
inhibitor of HbS polymerization. Since HbS polymerization occurs in the deoxygenated state, we believe that increasing the proportion of oxyhemoglobin, or &#147;left-shifting&#148; the OEC, should delay the polymerization of HbS and prevent the
sickling of RBCs, which may ameliorate many, of the clinical manifestations of SCD. Importantly, we are able to measure the proportion of hemoglobin modification (%HbMOD), which is expressed as the percentage of hemoglobin molecules occupied or
bound by GBT440. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">HbF, which is present during fetal development and persists for up to six to nine months in infants until it is replaced
by adult hemoglobin, has an inherent high affinity for oxygen, which is critical for a developing fetus to capture oxygen from the mother&#146;s blood. Newborns with SCD do not experience RBC sickling until approximately six to nine months of age,
after which HbF is no longer expressed. Additionally, it has been observed that rare individuals who have inherited the HbS mutation and a gene deletion that allows them to continue to express 10% to 30% HbF in their RBCs into adulthood do not
exhibit the clinical manifestations of SCD, despite expressing up to 90% sickled hemoglobin, or HbS, in their blood. HbF dilutes the concentration of deoxygenated HbS that can participate in polymerization, and thereby prevents hemoglobin polymer
from forming. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on these observations, we believe that to delay polymerization of HbS, GBT440 would need to bind to only approximately
10% to 30% of the total hemoglobin in a patient&#146;s blood. One theoretical concern regarding increasing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is that excessive oxygen affinity could prevent hemoglobin from releasing oxygen into the tissues, thus
causing hypoxia. However, based on HbF data, our animal toxicology studies, and our clinical studies, we believe our target modification of the total hemoglobin in a patient&#146;s blood would not adversely compromise oxygen delivery to the tissues.

15 days in healthy subjects and 28 days in SCD subjects), and Part C (multiple dose administration, daily for 90 days in SCD subjects). An extension study for patients in Part C to dose some patients for up to 6 months is referred to as GBT440-024.

measuring the blood levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin and reticulocyte counts. We also measured LDH as an additional marker of hemolysis; however it is generally more variable and nonspecific
because it is released from tissues other than RBCs and does not measure extravascular hemolysis which is the primary hemolytic mechanism in SCD. In this clinical trial, we also evaluated the effect of GBT440 on morphologic sickling of RBCs. We
believe that findings of decreased hemolysis and anti-sickling activity provide evidence of inhibition of sickle hemoglobin polymerization, which may translate into improved symptoms, reduction in clinical events (such as vaso-occlusive crisis) and
reduced organ damage due to RBC sickling. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Figure 1 &#150; Study Design of our Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of GBT440 </B></P>

Hematology, or ASH, meeting in December 2015, additional results from this clinical trial at the European Hematological Association meeting in June 2016 and additional results at the ASH meeting in December 2016. As of the most recent data available
to us in November 2016 in preparation for the ASH meeting, we dosed 48 subjects in Part A single dose administration cohorts. Additionally, in Part B multiple dose administration cohorts, we dosed 62 subjects, comprised of 24 healthy volunteers (18
of whom received GBT440 and six of whom received placebo) and 38 SCD subjects (28 of whom received GBT440 and 10 of whom received placebo). We initiated the first cohort in the Part C 90-day dose administration in SCD subjects in December 2015 and
presented these data at EHA. Additionally, we initiated an extension study, GBT440-024, to allow for the 90 day 900 mg cohort to receive GBT440 for up to six months. Also, 2 subjects with SCD have been enrolled in an ongoing cohort of subjects with
HbSC or HbS/ &szlig;+thalassemia. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Overall, a total of 261 subjects, including 205 healthy subjects and 49 adult SCD subjects and 7
adolescent subjects with SCD, have been administered single or multiple doses of GBT440 across 11 clinical studies. A total of 97 subjects (48 healthy subjects and 49 SCD subjects) have received GBT440 in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial, GBT440-001 and
its extension to 6 months, GBT440-024. Seven adolescent participants (median age of 16 years) received a single dose of GBT440 at 600 mg in the single dose and pharmacokinetic portion (Part A) of Study GBT440-007. In addition to these Phase 1/2
clinical trials, there are eight clinical pharmacology studies (four completed and four ongoing), in which a total of 157 healthy subjects have received GBT440. The most commonly reported adverse events, or AEs, regardless of treatment causality,
across SCD subjects included mild or moderate headache, pain (both headache and pain were reported more frequently in the placebo arm than in the GBT440 treatment arms), rash, back pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and cough. All events of diarrhea were
mild. Most of these events resolved without treatment and are easily monitored. Some adults with SCD experienced acute painful sickle cell crisis in the follow-up period after drug discontinuation or dose holds, which was thought to be related to
underlying SCD, and not to GBT440. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on data available for review in November 2016 from our Phase 1/2 clinical study, no
drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, have been reported. No SAEs were reported in the single dose cohorts or in healthy subjects who received multiple doses of GBT440. A total of 10 SAEs, each of which were assessed to be not related to
study drug, were reported in SCD subjects in the multiple dose cohorts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The pharmacokinetic data from SCD subjects shows a dose
proportional increase in GBT440 exposure following single and multiple dosing. The half-life was observed to be approximately 2.8 days in healthy subjects and 1.6 days in SCD subjects. The shorter half-life in SCD subjects may be due to higher RBC
turnover and/or anemia in SCD. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Among the 41 SCD patients who received multiple doses of GBT440 (at doses of either 500 mg, 700 mg, 900 mg,
or 1000 mg per day) in our Phase 1/2 clinical study for 28 days up to six months, 100% of study subjects demonstrated a hematologic response to GBT440 therapy, as evidenced by significant improvement in one or more clinical markers of hemolysis and
anemia (hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin and percentage reticulocyte counts). In addition, all study cohorts showed marked reductions in irreversibly sickled RBCs in the peripheral blood from baseline, and all study subjects treated for 90 days up
to six months showed sustained improvement in bilirubin and percentage of reticulocyte counts, continued reductions in sickled RBCs and a median 1.0g/dL increase in hemoglobin. There was no evidence of tissue hypoxia; trends to erythropoietin
reductions and the reduction in reticulocyte counts were consistent with an improvement in tissue oxygen delivery; oxygen delivery to tissues at rest and during exercise was normal. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As presented at the ASH meeting in December 2016, the tables below show that SCD subjects in our Phase 1/2 study who were treated for 90 days
to six months with GBT440 showed a durable and significant hemoglobin increase as compared to placebo. In addition, SCD subjects in this study showed sustained improvements in bilirubin level as well as counts of reticulocyte and irreversibly
sickled cells, and a greater increase in hemoglobin than at day 28. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>Durable Effect: Significant Hemoglobin Increase Maintained with

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In hypoxemic pulmonary disorders, where the lungs cannot supply adequate oxygen to the blood, we believe that hemoglobin modifiers such as
GBT440 that left-shift the oxy-hemoglobin equilibrium curve have the potential to enable increased oxygen uptake in the lungs, resulting in increased blood oxygen saturation and improved oxygen delivery to tissues. The primary goal in treating
patients affected by these disorders is to compensate for the reduced oxygen diffusion associated with the underlying lung disease by increasing hemoglobin oxygen affinity and in turn increasing blood oxygen content. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are evaluating our lead product candidate GBT440 in patients with IPF, a fatal disease
characterized by irreversible, progressive fibrosis or scarring of the lungs. The prognosis is poor for patients with IPF, which typically occurs primarily in people over 50 years old, with a median survival time from diagnosis of two to three
years. It is estimated that there are less than 150,000 patients with IPF in the United States. The scarring of the lungs leads to a reduction in the diffusion of oxygen from the lung to the blood resulting in hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen levels,
which is believed to play a key role in IPF patients&#146; symptoms, disease co-morbidities and adverse patient outcomes. Ultimately, the progressive worsening of lung function over time leads to organ dysfunction, frequent hospitalizations and
death. Since GBT440 is intended to specifically treat the hypoxemia associated with IPF, we believe that if GBT440 is shown to be safe and effective in IPF patients, it may have the potential to be administered in combination with other therapeutics
that focus on slowing the rate of disease progression, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Supplemental oxygen therapy is a
well-established treatment in chronic hypoxemic conditions, but is associated with a significant burden on the patients&#146; quality of life due to demands of the delivery equipment that ultimately can lead to significantly impaired mobility and
psychosocial decline. In addition, IPF patients who are prescribed supplemental oxygen therapy may still have significant periods of oxygen desaturation, leading to symptoms and reductions in physical activity. Accordingly, we believe an orally
administered drug that improves oxygen uptake and delivery may improve dyspnea, cough and other symptoms related to hypoxemia and may have the potential to improve quality of life, reduce IPF exacerbations and healthcare utilization. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have observed in a mouse model of hypoxia, referred to below as Study 1 that oral dosing with a hemoglobin-modifying analog of GBT440
reduces hypoxemia under conditions of extreme hypoxia (5% oxygen, far lower than 21% atmospheric or room air oxygen). Furthermore, treated animals demonstrated improved hemodynamic measures including blood pressure and increased survival rates
compared to control, as shown in the figure below. We believe this result is based upon the compound&#146;s effect on increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity and the associated increase in blood oxygen content. </P>

hypoxemic lung injury and bleomycin-induced fibrosis. In these animal studies, we also observed improvements in hypoxemia and tissue oxygenation in animals treated with the hemoglobin-modifying analog of GBT440 compared to controls. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the fibrosis model (Study 3), bleomycin was administered to induce fibrosis and hypoxemia over a period of two weeks and then treated with a
GBT440 analog or control. As shown in the graph below, the administration of the GBT440 analog resulted in a significant improvement in hypoxemia (oxygen saturation). The results of these studies suggest that a hemoglobin-modifying agent such as
GBT440 may improve oxygen uptake in a lung with compromised oxygen diffusion capacity, such as fibrosis. </P>

complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent, if any, is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance.
Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are
currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any patents, if issued, will provide sufficient protection from competitors for our business. </P>

Argentina, Taiwan and other countries. With regard to our lead product candidate GBT440 specifically, we are the sole owner of three issued U.S. patents that cover GBT440 (U.S. Patent
Nos.&nbsp;9,018,210, 9,248,199, and 9,447,071). U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;9,018,210, issued on April&nbsp;28, 2015, covers the composition of matter for GBT440, U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;9,248,199, issued on February&nbsp;2, 2016, covers methods of use of
GBT440, and U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;9,447,071, issued on September&nbsp;20, 2016, and covers a polymorph of GBT440. These issued U.S. patents covering our lead product candidate will expire in 2032, 2034, and 2035, respectively, absent any applicable
patent term extensions. Any patents that may issue from our other patent applications relating to GBT440 in the United States or from corresponding PCT and foreign patent applications, if issued, would be expected to expire between 2032 and 2037,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent
claims priority, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO the extent of which is offset by
delays by the patent owner before the USPTO in obtaining the patent. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by a terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent. The term of a U.S. patent may be
eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the
patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the
composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended
expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that
covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if our lead product candidate GBT440 or any other product candidates receive FDA approval, we would expect to apply for patent term extension on patents, if issued,
covering those products, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Trade secrets </I></B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We intend to begin building a commercial infrastructure in the United States and to consider building additional capabilities that may be
necessary to effectively support the commercialization of GBT440 when we believe a regulatory approval in a particular geography is likely. Because SCD is a rare disease in several significant geographic markets, with a concentrated prescribing
audience and a small number of key opinion leaders who significantly influence the treatments prescribed for the relevant patient population, we believe that we can effectively address the market using our own targeted, specialty sales and marketing
organization supported by internal sales personnel, an internal marketing group and distribution support. Additional capabilities important to the SCD and hematology marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care
organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside of the United States and core European markets, where appropriate, we
may utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to expand the commercial availability of GBT440. In addition, we believe the other indications that we may pursue with our product candidates can also be addressed with a small,
dedicated sales force. We currently do not expect that we will require large pharmaceutical partners for the commercialization of our product candidates, although we may consider partnering in certain territories or indications or for other
strategic purposes. We intend to evaluate our commercialization strategy as we advance our preclinical programs in other rare disease indications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Competition </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The biopharmaceutical
industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to
our product candidates or address similar markets. In addition, the number of companies seeking to develop and commercialize products and therapies similar to our product candidates is likely to increase. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the area of SCD, we expect to face competition from hydroxyurea (marketed as DROXIA or Hydrea by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company as well as in
generic form), which is currently the only approved therapeutic for the treatment of adults with SCD. Several companies are also developing product candidates for chronic treatment in SCD, including Novartis AG, which is engaged in the clinical
development of crizanlizumab, an anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody, Sancilio, which has announced they will be initiating a phase 3 trial for SC411, docosahexaenoic acid, and Emmaus, which has filed an NDA for pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine.
Several other agents are in early clinical trials investigating new mechanisms of action for the chronic treatment of SCD. We also expect to face competition from one-time therapies for SCD, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, gene
therapy and gene editing. For example, bluebird bio, Inc. is currently engaged in the clinical development of LentiGlobin BB305, which aims to treat SCD by inserting a functional human beta-globin gene into the patient&#146;s own hematopoietic stem
cells, or HSCs, ex vivo and then transplanting the modified stem cell into the patient&#146;s bloodstream. While not directly competitive with preventative agents like GBT440, several agents are also in development for the acute treatment of SCD
crises including rivipansel, being developed by Pfizer Inc. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the area of IPF, we expect to face competition from the approved
therapeutics, including pirfenidone (marketed by Genentech a member of the Roche Group as Esbriet in the U.S., Canada, EU, and other markets, by Shionogi as Pirespa in Japan, and in generic form in certain markets) and nintedanib, marketed by
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH in the U.S. and EU as Ofev. In addition, there are several other anti-fibrotic agents in Phase 2 studies that could impact the future IPF landscape. Since GBT440&#146;s approach is to address the hypoxemic aspects of IPF,
we believe that GBT440 could be administered potentially in combination with other disease modifying therapeutics such as pirfenidone and nintedanib. </P>

greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those
treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our
competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more
rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. </P>

clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of
qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#146;s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any
clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety
and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB for each institution at which the
clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided
to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public
registries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Clinical trials </I></P>

to the FDA, as well as written IND safety reports to the FDA and the study investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from
animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and
Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or
patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if
the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or
committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies
and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing
process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must include methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate
packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. </P>

results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of
an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in
accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be legally marketed in the United States. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA is typically accompanied by a user fee (adjusted on an annual basis).
According to the FDA&#146;s fee schedule, effective through September&nbsp;30, 2017, the user fee for an NDA is approximately $2 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for human drugs (approximately $98,000). Fee waivers or reductions are
available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business having fewer than 500 employees. Additionally, an application for a product that has been designated as a drug for a
rare disease or condition (referred to as an orphan drug) under section 526 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is not subject to an application fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition.

additional information or clarification. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing
facilities for the new product (including the facilities of contract manufacturers, if applicable) to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes
and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements.
Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review,
evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
There are likely to be extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is very comprehensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to
complete. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes
commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form,
and usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The complete response letter may require additional clinical data and/or additional clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements
related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if
such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>United States Orphan

Drug Act in the United States, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States (or more
than 200,000 individuals in the United States in limited circumstances). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential
orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but does confer other potential development and commercialization
benefits as described below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we submit an NDA seeking approval for GBT440 for the treatment of sickle cell disease, this NDA
submission should qualify for the orphan user fee exemption from the PDUFA application fee. In addition, we should qualify for additional incentives, including tax credits for qualifying clinical trials, and may also qualify for a substantial period
of market exclusivity. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the
FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan
exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or by providing a major contribution to patient care. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and
may obtain approval for the same product for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. A competitor could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years by obtaining orphan product exclusivity for

potential treatment of sickle cell disease. The FDA&#146;s Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life threatening condition, where nonclinical or clinical
data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. </P>

to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in
safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A product candidate may obtain accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful
advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is
reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or another significant clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require that the drug sponsor perform post-approval clinical trials, and may
impose marketing restrictions to limit distribution or use to assure safe use of the drug. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, a drug may be eligible for
designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate
substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as a Fast Track designation, in addition to intensive guidance from FDA to
ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. </P>

pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which was signed into law in
2012, requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study
Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no end-of-Phase 2 meeting as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or

things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution
of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws.
Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP requirements, could
result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recall. </P>

any application for patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our GBT440 product candidate, depending on the expected length of the
clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Marketing exclusivity provisions under the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act provide a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not
previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. So far as we are aware, GBT440 would qualify as a new chemical entity under these provisions.
During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is
intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four
years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator who holds the NDA for the active agent. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA for a
drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval
of the application, for example for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not
prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Five-year and three-year
exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA by a competitor. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials
necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the
United States which, if granted, adds six months to the end of existing exclusivity periods and patent terms, and may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued pre-approval written request for
such a pediatric trial where information relating to the use of the product candidate in a pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population. </P>

only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities has been obtained. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similar to the United States,
the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out
common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the
current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs.
Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. </P>

for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, designated GBT440 as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of sickle cell disease. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, requirements
and benefits to US orphan drug status, including 10 years of marketing exclusivity from the approval of the marketing application, designated product-specific consultation by the EMA, and certain reductions or exemptions in regulatory fees. </P>

products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire
territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or
tissue-engineered medicines, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. This
mandatory Centralized Procedure applies in the case of GBT440 for sickle cell disease, in light of the 2016 designation of GBT440 as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of sickle cell disease. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that
constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">National
MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already
been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of
application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the
MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling
and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the
assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an
assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>European

for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator&#146;s data to assess a
generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#146;s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years
if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to
bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the EU, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the EMA&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug
designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU Community (or where it
is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would
be a significant benefit to those affected). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction
of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the
product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or
shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In November 2016 we were granted orphan drug designation in the EU for GBT440 for the potential treatment of SCD. </P>

other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to
country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government
health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of
reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. The coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly and is likely to require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of
our product candidates to each payor individually, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The United
States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement
and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed
by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, and mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#146; share of sales to federal health care
programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the
Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer&#146;s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the ACA made several changes to the
Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers&#146; rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP,
and adding a </P>

new rebate calculation for &#147;line extensions&#148; (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products and potentially impacting
their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as
of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits (phased-in by 2014). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug
plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by
Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D
prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be
developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies
only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction
in payments from non-governmental payors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B
programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP
and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception
of children&#146;s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition
described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive
regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. We expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States will continue to
increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory
approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In most foreign countries, the
proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict
the range of medicinal products, for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may
instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices
tend to be significantly lower. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if
approved. </P>

multiple doses of GBT440 in a Phase 2a clinical trial of adolescent patients with SCD. We are also conducting two Phase 2a studies of GBT440 for the potential treatment of hypoxemia in patients with IPF, as well as a complementary Phase 1 study of
GBT440 in healthy volunteers to evaluate the physiologic effects of GBT440 under hypoxic conditions and exercise conditions that maximally stress heart and lung function. GBT440 is our only product candidate, though, we are conducting nonclinical

we had working capital of $134.3 million and $140.1 million, respectively and capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities totaling $197.3 million and $148.5 million respectively. Because
the outcome of any clinical development and regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual capital amounts necessary to successfully complete the development, regulatory approval process and
commercialization of GBT440 or any other future product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2015, we sold 6,900,000 shares of common stock in our

follow-on offering, the net proceeds of which totaled&nbsp;$117.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In October 2016, we filed our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the potential
offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $250 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and/or units. In February 2017, we completed the sale of 5,867,347 shares of common stock
in a follow-on offering under the shelf registration, the net proceeds of which totaled&nbsp;approximately $135.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We expect that our existing capital
resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. After the completion of this follow-on offering in February 2017, up to a maximum aggregate
offering price of $106.2 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units remain available under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, we have invested a majority of our efforts and financial resources in the nonclinical
and clinical development of our lead and initial product candidate GBT440, including conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any other clinical product
candidates. Our future success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize GBT440 for one or more potential indications. Before we can generate any revenues from sales of GBT440, we
must conduct substantial additional clinical development (including, among others, multiple ongoing clinical studies and toxicology studies, and possibly additional future nonclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of
GBT440 for any potential indication). In addition, we will need to seek and obtain regulatory approval for any potential indication, secure an adequate manufacturing supply to support larger clinical trials and commercial sales and build a
commercial organization. Further, the success of GBT440 as a potential commercial product will also depend on patent and trade secret protection, acceptance of GBT440 by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, its ability to compete
with other therapies, the status and availability of healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement, and maintenance of an acceptable safety and efficacy profile following approval, among other factors. If we do not achieve all of these factors in a
timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize GBT440, which would materially harm our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">GBT440 is currently our only product candidate to have advanced into clinical trials. We are developing GBT440 as an oral, once-daily therapy
for the potential treatment of SCD, and are currently evaluating GBT440 in SCD patients in ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trials and in the HOPE Study, which is a recently initiated Phase 3 clinical trial in adult and adolescent SCD patients. In
addition, we are conducting a Phase 1/2 program evaluating GBT440 for the potential treatment of hypoxemia in IPF. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All of our other
programs are in an early, nonclinical stage of research and development, and we have no other product candidates in clinical trials. Out of our ongoing internal early-stage nonclinical research, we have not selected any other product candidates that
would enable the filing of an IND. As a result, we are very dependent on our lead product candidate GBT440 for our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also very dependent on the data and results that we obtain over time from our most advanced clinical trial of our lead product
candidate, GBT440. In late 2016, we initiated the HOPE study, which is designed to enroll up to 400 SCD patients, age 12 years and older, who have had at least one episode of vaso-occlusive crisis in the previous year. The primary endpoint of the
HOPE study relates to the proportion of patients who achieve an increase in hemoglobin levels (compared to baseline) as pre-specified in the study protocol. We have not previously conducted any clinical study of GBT440 in SCD patients using this
primary endpoint, and we do not believe this measure has been used as a primary endpoint for any registration studies for any other SCD therapies. In addition, the HOPE study will also use a new patient reported outcomes, or PRO, instrument that we
recently developed, and that has not been utilized before in any clinical studies, to generate data for a secondary endpoint in the HOPE study. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our discussions with the FDA have focused on a pathway to full approval of GBT440 for the potential treatment of SCD patients based on the
HOPE study, by meeting the primary endpoint and at least one key secondary endpoint. However, before being able to seek or to obtain full or conditional approval of GBT440 for the potential treatment of SCD, we may be required to conduct one or more
additional clinical trials of GBT440, including one or more additional Phase 3 clinical trials or other studies. We do not have a special protocol assessment agreement in place with the FDA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot be certain that GBT440 or any other product candidates that we seek to develop will be successful in nonclinical studies or clinical
trials or receive any regulatory approvals. If we do not receive regulatory approval for, or otherwise fail to successfully commercialize, GBT440 or any other product candidates, we are likely to need to spend significant additional time and
resources to identify other product candidates, advance them through nonclinical and clinical development and apply for regulatory approvals, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The development of GBT440 as a potential disease-modifying anti-sickling agent in SCD patients and as a
treatment for hypoxemia in patients with IPF each represent novel therapeutic approaches, and there is a risk that the outcomes of our clinical trials will not be favorable or otherwise support any decision to seek or grant any regulatory approval.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have concentrated our product research and development efforts on developing novel, mechanism-based therapeutics for the
treatment of grievous blood-based disorders with significant unmet need, including SCD and IPF, and our future success depends on the successful development of this therapeutic approach. The clinical trial requirements of the FDA and other
comparable regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of any product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential product. To
date, there is only one approved therapy for SCD, hydroxyurea, and there are no approved therapeutics directed toward preventing the polymerization of hemoglobin molecules as a mechanism to reduce red blood cell sickling in SCD patients. As a
result, the design and conduct of clinical trials for a therapeutic such as GBT440 that targets this mechanism in SCD patients are subject to unknown risks, and we may experience setbacks with our ongoing or planned clinical trials of GBT440 in SCD
because of the limited clinical experience with its mechanism of action in these patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In particular, regulatory authorities in the
United States have not issued definitive guidance as to how to measure and achieve efficacy in treatments for SCD. Based on our discussion with the FDA regarding the design for the HOPE study, we have determined to measure change in hemoglobin
levels as the primary endpoint in the HOPE study. This primary endpoint has not been used previously in a registration study for any SCD treatment. As a result, regulators have not determined that such data would signify a clinically meaningful
result in SCD patients or would support seeking or obtaining regulatory approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With the exception of oxygen supplementation, there is
currently no approved therapy to relieve low oxygenation in patients with hypoxemic pulmonary disorders such as IPF. Similar to our development program in SCD, the design and conduct of clinical trials for a therapeutic agent that targets this
mechanism in IPF are subject to unknown risks, and we may experience setbacks with our ongoing or planned clinical trials of GBT440 because of the lack of clinical experience with its mechanism of action in IPF patients. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may not achieve our pre-specified endpoints in the HOPE study, or in other clinical trials where there is limited or no regulatory guidance
regarding appropriate clinical endpoints, which would decrease the probability of obtaining marketing approval for GBT440 or any other product candidate we may develop. Any inability to design clinical trials with protocols and endpoints acceptable
to applicable regulatory authorities, and to obtain regulatory approvals for GBT440 and any other product candidates that we may pursue, would have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, and initial studies may not establish an adequate safety or efficacy
profile for GBT440 and other product candidates that we may pursue to justify proceeding to advanced clinical trials or an application for regulatory approval. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials of GBT440, our other product candidates and future product candidates that we may pursue
may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial may not necessarily predict final results. For example, our nonclinical studies and clinical trials to date of GBT440 in SCD have involved
mostly one genotype of SCD, known as HbSS, and the results of these studies may not be replicated in other genotypes of SCD or in subsequent clinical trials. The HOPE study of GBT440 in SCD is not limited to only the HbSS genotype. Additionally, any
positive results generated in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of GBT440 in SCD in adults do not ensure that we will achieve similar results in the HOPE study, which will enroll both adult and adolescent populations, or our ongoing Phase 2a clinical
trial of GBT440 in adolescents with SCD, or in any other potential indications for GBT440, such as IPF and other hypoxemic pulmonary disorders. Our later stage clinical trials, such as the HOPE study, may involve significantly broader patient
populations than those in earlier clinical trials. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials, such as our recently initiated HOPE study,
may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced
clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed
their product candidates performed satisfactorily in nonclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval, in part because of differing interpretations of data and results by regulatory authorities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our failure to demonstrate the required characteristics to support marketing approval for GBT440 or any other product candidate we may choose
to develop in any ongoing or future clinical trials would substantially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Before we are able to submit GBT440 for marketing approval, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may impose additional requirements,
the scope of which are not fully known at this time. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before we can submit an NDA to the FDA for GBT440 for any potential
indication, we must successfully complete our clinical trials including at least one or more additional larger clinical trials. The FDA typically requires at least two pivotal, well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials as a condition to the submission
of an NDA and does not usually consider a single Phase 3 clinical trial to be adequate to support product approval. The FDA will typically only consider relying on one pivotal trial if, in addition, other well-controlled studies of the drug exist
(for example, for other dosage forms or in other populations) or if the pivotal trial is a multi-center trial that provides highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of an important clinical benefit, such as effect on survival, organ
function or patient reported outcomes and a confirmatory study would have been difficult to conduct on ethical grounds. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on our
discussions with the FDA regarding the design of the HOPE study of GBT440 in SCD patients, we believe that if the HOPE study meets the primary endpoint and at least one key secondary endpoint, the data and results from this Phase 3 clinical trial
could form the basis for regulatory approval of GBT440 for SCD treatment. However, before being able to seek or to obtain full or even conditional approval of GBT440 for the treatment of SCD, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials
or nonclinical studies of GBT440, including one or more additional Phase 3 clinical trials or other studies. The FDA may also require a longer follow-up period for subjects treated with GBT440 prior to accepting an NDA submission. We do not have a
special protocol assessment agreement in place with the FDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA or the comparable foreign authorities may not consider the results of
our ongoing (including our HOPE study in SCD patients), planned or potential future clinical trials, to be sufficient for approval of GBT440 for SCD patients or hypoxemia in IPF patients. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities
require additional clinical trials or data beyond that which we currently anticipate, we would incur increased costs and delays in the clinical development and marketing approval process, which may require us to expend more resources than are
available to us. In addition, it is possible that the FDA and the comparable foreign authorities may have divergent opinions on the elements necessary for a successful NDA and Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, respectively, which may
cause us to alter our development, regulatory and/or commercialization strategies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may encounter substantial delays in conducting or completing

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in our ongoing and planned clinical trials of GBT440, especially for the multi-national
Phase 3 HOPE study, and any other product candidates that we may develop are critical to our success. Our clinical development efforts are initially focused on rare chronic blood diseases. For example, according to CDC estimates, the prevalence of
SCD, for which GBT440 is being studied, is 90,000 to 100,000 individuals in the United States. For IPF, it is estimated that there are less than 150,000 people in the United States that are affected. Accordingly, there are limited patient pools from
which to draw for clinical trials in our target indications. The HOPE study is designed to enroll up to 400 adult and adolescent SCD patients in multiple study centers in the United States, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. We may not be able to
identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficient number of subjects to complete the HOPE study or our other clinical trials of GBT440 because of the perceived risks and benefits of GBT440, the availability of competing therapies and clinical trials, the
proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective subjects and the subject referral practices of physicians, among other factors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, if subjects in our clinical trials fail to comply with our dosing regimens, we may not be able to generate clinical data acceptable to
the FDA in our trials. For our HOPE study of GBT440 in adult and adolescent SCD patients, enrolled participants must use a patient reported outcomes, or PRO, instrument to complete very frequent patient surveys generating data relevant to a
secondary endpoint. If HOPE study participants fail to comply consistently with these PRO-related steps and procedures, the quality of these study data and our ability to interpret these data and results could be impaired, and these data and results
may not be acceptable to the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities or may be interpreted differently. If patients are unwilling or unable to participate in, complete or comply with the protocols for our studies for any reason, the timeline for
recruiting subjects, conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we experience
difficulties or delays in enrollment or are otherwise unable to successfully complete any clinical trial of GBT440, especially the HOPE study, or any other product candidates we may pursue, our costs are likely to increase, and our ability to obtain
regulatory approval and generate product revenue from any of these product candidates will be impaired. Any of these occurrences would harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If serious adverse events or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to delay, limit or
terminate our clinical development activities. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical trials by their nature utilize only a small sample of the potential
patient population. Our Phase 1/2 clinical program of GBT440 in SCD patients and IPF patients are providing only very limited experience of GBT440 in SCD patients and IPF patients. For example, our Phase 1/2a clinical trials of GBT440 in SCD are
designed to enroll between 96 and 128 subjects, and our ongoing Phase 2a clinical trials of hypoxemia in IPF patients are designed to enroll only up to 49 subjects. In contrast, the HOPE study is designed to enroll up to 400 adult and adolescent SCD
patients. However, even this larger trial design will enroll only a very small fraction of all patients with SCD. Any rare and severe side effects of GBT440 may be uncovered only in later stages of our ongoing clinical trials (such as our larger
HOPE study), or only in trials involving different patient populations (such as pediatric patients or IPF patients), or only during post-approval studies or safety reporting. Many product candidates that initially showed promise in early stage
testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Moreover, a nonclinical toxicology study with GBT440 in non-humans and clinical trials involving other hemoglobin modifiers (other than GBT440) have shown
a decrease in oxygen </P>

resulting in tissue hypoxia. To date, clinical studies of GBT440 have not shown evidence of tissue hypoxia. However, if GBT440 or any other product candidates that we may develop are associated with tissue hypoxia or any other undesirable side
effects or unexpected undesirable characteristics in clinical trials or nonclinical studies, we may need to abandon their development or limit their development to more narrow uses or subpopulations, which could adversely affect our business,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe there may be an opportunity to accelerate the development of our lead product candidate GBT440 through one or more of the FDA&#146;s

candidates that we may develop will qualify for or benefit from any such programs in the United States or any foreign regulatory jurisdictions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2015, the FDA designated our investigation of GBT440 for the treatment of SCD as a Fast Track development program. Fast Track is a process
designated to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. While Fast Track designation may provide more frequent access and
communication with the FDA, it does not ensure that regulatory review or approval for GBT440 will occur on an expedited basis, if at all. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more
other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Although
breakthrough designation or access to any other expedited program may expedite the development or approval process, it does not change the standards for approval. If we apply for breakthrough therapy designation or any other expedited designation
for GBT440, the FDA may determine that GBT440, our proposed target indication or other aspects of our clinical development plans do not qualify for such expedited program. Even if we are successful in obtaining a breakthrough therapy designation or
access to any other expedited program through the FDA or any other regulatory authority, we may not experience faster development timelines or achieve faster review or approval compared to conventional FDA or foreign regulatory procedures. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, access to an expedited program, if provided, may be withdrawn by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities if it believes that the
designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Additionally, qualification for Fast Track or any other expedited review procedure does not ensure that ultimately we will obtain regulatory approval for GBT440 or any
other product candidate that we may develop in a timely manner, or at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Although the FDA and the European Commission have each granted orphan
drug designation to our lead product candidate GBT440 for the potential treatment of SCD, we may not receive orphan drug designation for any other product candidates for which we may submit new applications for orphan drug designation, and any

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our business strategy focuses on the development of product candidates for the treatment of rare, chronic blood disorders that may be eligible
for FDA or European Union, or EU, orphan drug designation. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the EU, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act,
the FDA may designate a drug as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. In the EU, the Committee for

Products of the EMA recommends orphan drug designation to promote the development of medical products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or
chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment is authorized (or in other very limited circumstances). In 2015 and 2016,
respectively, the FDA and the European Commission (acting on a positive recommendation by the EMA) each granted orphan drug designation for GBT440 for the treatment of patients with SCD. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Generally, if a drug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has
such designation, the drug is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable period is
seven years in the United States and 10 years in the EU. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is
no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients
with the rare disease or condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although the FDA and the EMA have each granted orphan drug designation to GBT440 for the treatment of
SCD, we may apply for orphan drug designation for GBT440 in other jurisdictions or for other indications, or for other product candidates we may develop and pursue in the future. Applicable regulatory authorities may not grant us these additional
designations. In addition, the exclusivity granted under any orphan drug designations that we have received or may receive may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same
condition. For example, in the United States, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior, or the FDA can approve a
competitor application for the same drug for a different indication than the orphan drug designation. Any inability to secure or maintain orphan drug designation or the exclusivity benefits of this designation would have an adverse impact on our
ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Even if we receive regulatory approval for our lead product candidate GBT440 or any
other product candidate that we may develop and pursue, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and scrutiny and may be subject to significant restrictions relating to product labeling, distribution or other post-marketing requirements.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if a product candidate such as GBT440 is approved, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on its
indicated uses, approved labeling, distribution or marketing or may impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies. Furthermore, any new legislation addressing drug safety or other drug related issues could result in
delays or increased costs to assure compliance. If GBT440 or any other product candidates that we may develop are approved, at a minimum they will each be subject to current standard ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage,
advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims
that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization GBT440 or any other product candidates. For example, the development of GBT440 for the prophylactic treatment of SCD in pediatric patients is an important part of our current
business strategy, and if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for this product candidate for the desired age ranges or other key labeling parameters, our business is likely to suffer. </P>

documentation in support of an NDA or MAA seeking approval of a product candidate on a timely basis and must adhere to GLP and cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies through their facilities inspection programs. Some of
our contract manufacturers for GBT440 have never produced a commercially approved pharmaceutical product and therefore have not obtained the requisite regulatory authority pre-approval inspection or approvals to do so. The facilities and quality
systems of some or all of our third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our lead product candidate GBT440. In addition, the regulatory
authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of GBT440 or any of our future product candidates or the associated quality systems. Although we oversee the contract manufacturers, we cannot
control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with these complex regulatory requirements. If these manufacturers, facilities, records or systems do not pass pre-approval

our third-party contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we
or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that could be costly and/or time consuming for us or a third party to implement, and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical study or commercial sales or
the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business. </P>

possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications,
or to maintain the rights to patents licensed to third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our current or future licensors,
licensees or collaboration partners fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our licensors, licensees or collaboration partners are not fully cooperative
or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal, technological and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign
countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or vice versa. Further, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates. Publications of
discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not at all. Therefore,
we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope,
validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are and will remain highly uncertain. The patent examination process may require us or our licensors, licensees or collaboration partners to narrow the scope of the claims of our or
our licensors&#146;, licensees&#146; or collaboration partners&#146; pending and future patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents

unenforceable. Our and our licensors&#146;, licensees&#146; or collaboration partners&#146; patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from

preissuance submission of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, <I>inter partes</I> review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging
our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our product candidates and
compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent

could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical product candidates, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our product candidates. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing
and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude
others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The United States has enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging
patent reform legislation. The United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain
situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained. Depending on future actions by the
U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would diminish the value of our patents and patent applications or narrow the scope of our patent protection, or
weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Assuming the

claims. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. As a result of patent infringement
claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing our product candidates and would most likely be required to pay license
fees or royalties or both, that could be significant. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same
intellectual property licensed to us. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or forced to redesign it, or to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims,
we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, such litigation can be expensive, uncertain, and time consuming to litigate, and would divert management&#146;s attention from our

prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology similar or identical to ours, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO, to determine which party is entitled to a patent on
the disputed invention. We may also become involved in similar opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or similar offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates and

obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our
information technology systems, but it is possible that these security measures could be breached. Enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally and is using trade secrets or confidential know-how is expensive, time consuming and
unpredictable. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If any of our confidential proprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no
right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient

candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some
foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries worldwide, or
from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and
may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but patent enforcement is not strong. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or
sufficient to prevent them from competing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual

to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights, whether or not
successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and
could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual

In addition, the America Invents Act, or the AIA, has been recently enacted in the United States, resulting in significant changes to the U.S. patent system. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March&nbsp;16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a &#147;first-to-file&#148;
system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us
could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent
application, but circumstances could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on our inventions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Among some of the other
changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those

necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would
be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the
third party as a defendant in a district court action. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The USPTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, and many of the substantive changes to patent
law associated with the AIA, and, in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. However, the AIA and
its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our or our licensors&#146; or collaboration partners&#146; patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our licensors&#146; or collaboration

Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, such as Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. (Myriad I), Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., and Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS
Bank International, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents
in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could
change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, the complexity and uncertainty of European patent laws has also increased
in recent years. In addition, the European patent system is relatively stringent in the type of amendments that are allowed during prosecution. These changes could limit our ability to obtain new patents in the future that may be important for our

insurance coverage for our product candidates for any approved indications, and the extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors, will be essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments, such as we expect ours to

approved drug products. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may
limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not
imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. For example, the payor&#146;s reimbursement payment rate may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for
products can differ significantly from payor to payor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, significant decisions about reimbursement for new medicines

enters into contracts with drug manufacturers for discounted drug prices for Medicaid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The practices and requirements relating to the payment of rebates by drug manufacturers for Medicaid purchases are
determined by each state, and in some cases, if a company does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales will be subjected to a &#147;prior authorization&#148; procedure that requires state agency approval to qualify a doctor&#146;s
prescription for reimbursement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price
controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many
countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries
allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates.
Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may
cause such organizations to limit both coverage and levels of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in
connection with the sale of any of our product candidates, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative and political changes. The downward pressure on healthcare
costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, drug prices are under
significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products may be sold, and drug pricing and other healthcare costs continue to be subject to intense political and social pressures which we anticipate will continue and escalate on a global basis. As
a result, our business and reputation may be harmed, our stock price may be adversely impacted and experience periods of volatility, we may have difficulty raising funds and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. </P>

Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law, however, it is widely viewed as
the first step toward the passage of repeal legislation. Further, on January&nbsp;20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions
from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could
consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. We cannot predict how repeal efforts or any legislation passed to replace portions of the ACA will impact our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. After various complex
legislative and executive branch actions, starting in 2013 Medicare payment reductions to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year went into effect through 2025, unless Congressional action is taken. Further, there has been heightened governmental
scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing,
review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the price of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform
measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing
pressures. </P>

currently aware of various existing therapies and development candidates that may compete with our lead product candidate GBT440 for the potential treatment of SCD or IPF. We have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including
major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger research and development,
marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain
regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative
arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may
succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop, or achieve earlier patent protection, regulatory approval, product commercialization
and market penetration than we do. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors.

estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of
patients may turn out to be lower than expected. The effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is in early stages, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Additionally, the
potentially addressable patient population for each of our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which
would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Further, even if we obtain significant market share for our product candidates, because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability despite

number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates. Competition to hire qualified personnel in our industry and
geographic market is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. Furthermore, to the
extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output.
We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating
our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their

and, consequently, our results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control,
sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations (collectively, &#147;Trade Laws&#148;). We can face serious consequences for violations. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Among other matters, Trade Laws prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, legal counsel, accountants,
consultants, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private
sector. Violations of Trade Laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other
consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We also expect our non-U.S. activities to increase in time. We
engage third parties for clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents, or partners,
even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Unfavorable global economic and political conditions could
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to invest in and expand our business and
meet our financial obligations, to attract and retain third-party contractors and collaboration partners and to raise additional capital depends on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to numerous factors, including
the prevailing economic and political conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control, such as the rate of unemployment, the number of uninsured persons in the United States, the results of presidential elections, other
political influences and inflationary pressures. For example, an overall decrease in or loss of insurance coverage among individuals in the United States as a result of unemployment, underemployment or the potential repeal of certain provisions of
the ACA, may decrease the demand for healthcare services and pharmaceuticals. If fewer patients are seeking medical care because they do not have insurance coverage, we may experience difficulties in any eventual commercialization of our product
candidates and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, certain
events have caused, and may cause or contribute to global financial crises, which have triggered and may in the future lead to extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. For example, in June 2016, the United Kingdom, or
the U.K., held a referendum in which voters supported the exit of the U. K. from the EU (commonly referred to as &#147;Brexit&#148;), which could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our existing
relationships with third parties that conduct some of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials and our ability to enter into new relationships with vendors and other third-party contractors, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial results and operations. The referendum is non-binding, but if passed into law, negotiations would commence to determine the future terms of the U.K.&#146;s relationship with the EU, including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the EU.
Brexit has already and could continue to adversely affect European and/or worldwide economic and market conditions and could continue to contribute to instability in the global financial markets. The measures could also adversely affect our ability
to raise additional capital, potentially disrupt the markets in which we currently conduct and plan to conduct operations and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions.
In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate, which may present difficulties for our clinical and regulatory strategy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including reduced ability to raise additional

economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing
facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business
continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business
continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our internal computer systems, or those of our third party vendors, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of

third party vendors are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it
could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials or nonclinical studies for any of our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory
approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of
confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks

Section&nbsp;404, or Section&nbsp;404, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes Oxley, and the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market. Section&nbsp;404 generally requires our management and independent registered public accounting
firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Company responsibilities required by Sarbanes Oxley include establishing and maintaining corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting
and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. </P>

effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We expect to incur additional professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and to expend
significant management efforts in order to comply with these requirements. Previously we have never been required to test our internal controls within a specified period and, as a result, we may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting
requirements in a timely manner. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the reports required by Section&nbsp;404. Based on our assessment and using the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;) criteria, our management, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that, as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective. However, our independent registered public accounting firm has not yet tested the design or operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting or been required to provide an attestation report with respect to
our internal control over financial reporting, but will do so at a future date. During the course of our or their subsequent review and testing, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may be identified that we may be unable to remediate
them before we must provide the required reports. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are identified in the future, we may not detect or remediate errors on a timely basis and our
consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, which could harm
our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. In addition, as a public company we are required to file accurate and timely quarterly and annual
reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from The NASDAQ Global Select Market or other adverse consequences
that would materially harm our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure

&#147;emerging growth company&#148; as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have elected to take advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies,
including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and
exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of
(1)&nbsp;December 31, 2020, (2)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, (3)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means
the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June&nbsp;30th or (4)&nbsp;the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on certain reporting exemptions available to emerging growth companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a
less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The market price of our common stock has been and may

Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. For example, negative publicity regarding drug pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies has
negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against

reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, or similar changes in our capital stock. In addition, we have reserved shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, which number

as a new public company, and our management will devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a public company, we incur
significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Select Market has imposed various
requirements on public companies. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the
Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as &#147;say on pay&#148; and pay parity. Recent legislation permits smaller &#147;emerging growth companies&#148; to implement many of these
requirements over a longer period and up to five years from the pricing of our IPO. We have elected to take advantage of this legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or
planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations,
which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance
initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and
more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">New laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules adopted by the SEC and by NASDAQ, would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or
our business. Securities and industry analysts may not publish an adequate amount of research on our company, which may negatively impact the trading price for our stock. In addition, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock
or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline or increase in volatility. Further, if our operating results fail to meet the forecasts of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one
or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. </P>

evaluating GBT440 in SCD in a Phase 3 clinical trial of GBT440 in adult and adolescent patients with SCD. In addition, we are evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of GBT440 in a Phase 2 clinical trial of adolescent
patients with SCD. In December 2015, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation for GBT440 for the treatment of SCD and in November 2016 we were granted Orphan Drug Designation in Europe for
GBT440 for the treatment of SCD. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we are conducting two Phase 2 clinical trials of GBT440 for the potential treatment of IPF,
which is a hypoxemic pulmonary disorder. We are also engaged in other pre-clinical research and development activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SCD is marked by
red blood cell, or RBC, destruction and occluded blood flow and hypoxia, leading to anemia, stroke, multi-organ failure, severe pain crises, and shortened patient life span. GBT440 inhibits abnormal hemoglobin polymerization, the underlying
mechanism that causes sickling of RBCs. In our clinical trials to date of GBT440 in SCD patients, we observed reduced markers of red blood cell destruction, improvements in anemia, improvements in markers of tissue oxygenation, and reduced numbers
of sickled RBCs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also studying the potential for GBT440 to treat IPF, which is a fatal disease characterized by irreversible,
progressive scarring of the lungs. As an IPF patient&#146;s lung scarring worsens, the lungs cannot properly transport oxygen into the bloodstream and, as a result, the body&#146;s tissues do not get the oxygen they need. The cause of IPF is unknown
and there is no cure. Progression of lung scarring inevitably results in hypoxemia causing shortness of breath and a decline in overall function; eventually the use of supplemental oxygen is necessary. Ultimately, the progressive worsening of lung
function over time, leads to organ dysfunction, frequent hospitalizations and death. IPF typically affects individuals over the age of 50, and the median survival after diagnosis is approximately 2 to 3 years. </P>

consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting
periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our
historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management&#146;s judgments and estimates. </P>

include these costs in accrued liabilities in the balance sheet and within research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These costs are a significant component of our research and development

estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed, the number of subjects enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under our equity incentive plans and rights
to acquire stock granted under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model requires the use of assumptions, including the expected term of the award and the expected stock price volatility. We used the
&#147;simplified&#148; method, which is based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term, for the expected option term. We use peer company price volatility as well as the historical volatility of our own common
stock to estimate expected stock price volatility due to the limited trading history for our common stock since our IPO in August 2015. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in life cycle, or area of specialty. We
will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our stock price becomes available. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Restricted stock purchases (RSPs) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stock-based compensation expense was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and was reduced for estimated forfeitures at the
time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. We estimated annual forfeiture rates for stock options and RSPs based on our historical forfeiture experience. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The estimated fair value of stock options and RSPs is expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the grant and the estimated
fair value of performance-contingent options and RSPs is expensed using an accelerated method over the term of the award once we determine that it is probable that those performance milestones will be achieved. Compensation expense for RSPs that
contain performance conditions is based on the grant date fair value of the award. Compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period based on management&#146;s best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are
expected to vest. We assess the probability of the performance indicators being met on a continuous basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fair value of each share of
underlying common stock is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to our IPO, the fair values of the shares of common stock underlying our share-based awards were estimated on each grant date by our
board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of our common stock prepared by an unrelated third-party
valuation firm in accordance with the guidance provide by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Given the absence of a public trading
market for our common stock, our board of directors exercised their judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock, including: our stage of development;
progress of our research and development efforts; the rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies and the lack of marketability of
our common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Compensation expense for purchases under the ESPP is recognized based on the fair value of the common stock on the date

liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We periodically assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, our total deferred tax
assets, less our total deferred tax liabilities, were $70.1&nbsp;million. Due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a
valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Utilization of the net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership changes that may
have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions. These ownership change limitations may limit the amount of NOL
carryforwards and other tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an &#147;ownership change&#148; as defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code results from a transaction or series
of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50&nbsp;percentage points (by value) of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders. Since our formation, we have raised capital through the
issuance of capital stock on several occasions, which separately or combined with the purchasing stockholders&#146; subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in such ownership changes, or could result in ownership changes in the
future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Results of Operations </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Comparison of

any, through 2036, and approximately $151.8 million that may offset future state income taxes, if any, through 2036. Current federal and state tax laws include substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in
the event of an ownership change. Even if the carryforwards are available, they may be subject to annual limitations, lack of future taxable income, or future ownership changes that could result in the expiration of the carryforwards before they are
utilized. At December&nbsp;31, 2016, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately $70.1 million, as at that time our management believed it was uncertain that they would be fully realized. If we determine
in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, an adjustment to our net operating loss carryforwards would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination. </P>

267,228 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option to purchase additional shares in July 2016. We received aggregate proceeds of $117.0 million from the offering, net of underwriting discounts and
commissions, and offering expenses. In October 2016, we filed our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the potential offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $250 million of our common stock, preferred
stock, debt securities, warrants, and/or units. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had $92.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $105.2 million in marketable securities. In February 2017, we completed a follow-on offering under the shelf
registration pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 5,867,347 shares of our common stock at a price of $24.50 per share. We received aggregate proceeds of approximately $135.6 million from the offering, net of underwriting discounts and
commissions, and estimated offering expenses. After the completion of this follow-on offering in February 2017, up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $106.2 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units
remain available under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our primary use of cash is to fund operations, which consist

clinical development, to develop other potential product candidates from our research programs and to fund operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to seek funds through equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements
with corporate sources, or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial
condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) or other standards
setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements upon adoption. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#146;s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In doing so, companies
will have reduced diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures than under today&#146;s guidance. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-02, Leases. The new standard
requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease
expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months
regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018,
with early adoption permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position or results of operations. </P>

transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the consolidated statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after
December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We do not believe the impact of adopting this new standard on our financial position or results of operations will be material. </P>

Cash Payments. The new standard provides guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. We believe
that the adoption of this new standard will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations and have not elected to early adopt the amendment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-18, Restricted Cash. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain the
change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be
included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and interim

Based on our investment positions as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rate would result in a $1.0 million decline in the fair market value of our portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Global Blood Therapeutics Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148;, and &#147;our&#148;) was incorporated in Delaware in
February 2011 and commenced operations in May 2012. We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics to treat grievous blood-based disorders with significant unmet need.
Our primary activities have been establishing our facilities, recruiting personnel, conducting development of our product candidates, including clinical trials, and raising capital. Our principal operations are based in South San Francisco,
California, and we operate in one segment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Initial Public Offering </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2015, we closed our initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;), at which time we issued 6,900,000 shares of our common stock at a
price of $20.00 per share. We received $126.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses incurred by us. Upon the closing of our IPO, all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock converted
by their terms into 19,746,614 shares of common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Follow-on Offerings </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;24, 2016, we completed a follow-on offering and issued 6,400,000 shares of common stock at a price of $18.75 per share. In July
2016, we sold an additional 267,228 shares of our common stock directly to the underwriters when they exercised their over-allotment option at the price of $18.75 per share. We received total proceeds of $117.0 million from the offering, net of
underwriting costs and commissions, and offering expenses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2017, we completed a follow-on offering and issued an aggregate of
5,867,347 shares of our common stock at a price of $24.50 per share, including 765,306 shares of our common stock sold directly to the underwriters when they exercised their over-allotment option at the price of $24.50 per share. We received total
proceeds of approximately $135.6 million from the offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and estimated offering expenses. This amount was not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Need for Additional Capital </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the
course of our development activities, we have sustained operating losses and we expect such losses to continue over the next several years. Our ultimate success depends on the outcome of our research and development activities. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $180.9 million. We expect to incur additional losses in the future to conduct product research and development and we anticipate the need to raise additional capital to fully implement our
business plan. We intend to raise such capital through the issuance of additional equity, potentially through borrowings, and strategic alliances with partner companies. However, if such financing is not available at adequate levels or when it will
be required, we will need to reevaluate our operating plans. We believe that our existing capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalent and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve
months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of costs and expenses during the reporting
period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience when available and on various factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results
could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Principles of Consolidation </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Segment Reporting </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have determined that we operate in a single segment based upon the way the business is organized for making operating decisions and
assessing performance. The Company has only one operating segment related to the development of pharmaceutical products. All property and equipment is maintained in the United States. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents, which consist primarily of amounts invested in money market accounts, are stated at fair value.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Concentration of Credit Risk </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We invest in a variety of financial instruments and, by our policy, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer, industry or
geographic area for investments other than instruments backed by the U.S. federal government. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Investments in Marketable Securities </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We invest in marketable securities, primarily money market funds, corporate debt securities, government securities, government agency
securities, and certificates of deposits. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale securities and report them at fair value in cash equivalents or marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets with related unrealized
gains and losses included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheet. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which is
included in interest income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are included in interest and
other income (loss). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We regularly review all of our investments for other-than-temporary declines in estimated fair value. Our review includes the consideration of
the cause of the impairment, including the creditworthiness of the security issuers, the number of securities in an unrealized loss position, the severity and duration of the unrealized losses, whether we have the intent to sell the securities and
whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to </P>

sell the securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis. When we determine that the decline in estimated fair value of an investment is below the amortized cost basis and the
decline is other-than-temporary, we reduce the carrying value of the security and record a loss for the amount of such decline. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Fair Value
Measurement </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, three years for computer equipment and five years for laboratory equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the
improvements. Depreciation and amortization begins at the time the asset is placed in service. Maintenance and repairs are charged as expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of assets, the
cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We evaluate our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate over its remaining life.
If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. There have been no impairments of our long-lived assets for the periods
presented. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Restricted Cash </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Restricted cash consists of cash deposits held by our financial institution as collateral for our letter of credit under our facility lease.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We record accruals for estimated costs of research, nonclinical and clinical studies and manufacturing development. These costs are a
significant component of our research and development expenses. A substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities are conducted by third-party service providers, including contract research organizations and contract
manufacturing organizations. We accrue the costs incurred under our agreements with these third parties based on actual work completed in accordance with agreements established with these third parties. We determine the actual costs through
discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual
balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accruals. We have not experienced any material deviations between accrued clinical trial expenses and actual clinical trial expenses. However, actual services performed,
number of subjects enrolled, and the rate of subject enrollment may vary from our estimates, resulting in adjustments to clinical trial expense in future periods. Changes in these estimates that result in material changes to our accruals could
materially affect our results of operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We enter into lease agreements for our office and laboratory facilities. These leases are classified as operating leases. Rent expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the noncancelable term of the lease and, accordingly, we record the difference between cash rent payments and the recognition of rent expense as a deferred rent liability, which is included within other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Incentives granted under our facilities leases, including allowances to fund leasehold improvements, are deferred and are recognized as adjustments to rental expense on a straight-line basis over the
noncancelable term of the lease. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Comprehensive Income (Loss) </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as a change in equity of a business enterprise during a period, resulting from transactions from
non-owner sources. Our comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net loss and changes in unrealized gains and losses on our marketable securities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Research and Development </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist of salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, lab supplies and facility costs, as well as fees paid to other nonemployees and entities that conduct certain research and
development activities on our behalf. Amounts incurred in connection with license agreements are also included in research and development expense. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research
and development activities are capitalized and then expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Stock-Based
Compensation </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We measure and recognize stock-based compensation expense, including employee and non-employee equity awards, based
on fair value at the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to calculate fair value. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss is based on options
ultimately expected to vest, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense is revised in subsequent periods, if necessary, if actual forfeitures differ from these estimates. When estimating forfeitures, we
consider historic voluntary termination behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures. For options granted to nonemployees, we revalue the unearned portion of the stock-based compensation and at each reporting period end the resulting
change in fair value is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss over the period the related services are rendered. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Income Taxes </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We use the asset and
liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We must then assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Due to our lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize benefits of uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained upon examination based
solely on their technical merits, as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. It is our policy to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of other
expense and interest expense, respectively, as necessary. To date, there have been no interest or penalties charged in relation to the unrecognized tax benefits. </P>

weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration of common stock equivalents. The net loss attributable to common stockholders is calculated by adjusting our net loss for the accretion on the
redeemable convertible preferred stock. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, since the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive
given our net loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Recent Accounting Pronouncements </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern. ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In doing so, companies will have reduced diversity in
the timing and content of footnote disclosures than under today&#146;s guidance. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-02, Leases. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual
approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on
an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their
classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018, with early adoption
permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position or results of operations. </P>

transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the consolidated statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after
December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We do not believe the impact of adopting this new standard on our financial position or results of operations will be material. </P>

guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. We believe that the adoption of this new standard will
have no impact on our financial position or results of operations and have not elected to early adopt the amendment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2016,
the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-18, Restricted Cash. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or
restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown
on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. We believe that the adoption of this new standard will have no material impact on
our financial position or results of operations and have not elected to early adopt the amendment. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fair value accounting is applied for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated
financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities and restricted cash are reported at their respective fair values on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining financial instruments are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost that approximate current fair values due to
their relatively short maturities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets
are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a
liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair
value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Level 1&#151;</I>Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active

in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Level 3&#151;</I>Unobservable inputs that are significant to the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2015, we adopted the 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the &#147;2015 Plan&#148;). Under the 2015 Plan, 1,430,000 shares of our
common stock were initially reserved for the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, and other equity-based awards to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants under terms and provisions established by the Board of Directors and
approved by our stockholders. On January&nbsp;1, 2016, we increased the number of shares available under the 2015 Plan by 1,218,283 to a total of 2,648,283 shares. Awards granted under the 2015 Plan expire no later than 10 years from the date of
grant. For incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options, the option price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value on the day of grant. If at the time we grant an option and the optionee directly or by attribution owns stock
possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all our classes of stock, the option price is required to be at least 110% of the fair market value on the day of grant. Options granted typically vest over a 4-year period but may be
granted with different vesting terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>2012 Stock Option and Grant Plan </I></B></P>

to grant incentive stock options to employees, including officers and members of the Board of Directors who are also employees of ours, and non-statutory stock options (options that do not qualify as incentive options) and/or our restricted stock
and other equity-based awards to employees, officers, directors, or consultants of ours. Previously we had initially reserved 2,785,713 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2012 Plan. On April&nbsp;9, 2015 we increased the number of shares
available under the 2012 Plan by 1,000,000 to a total of 3,785,713 shares. Awards granted under the 2012 Plan expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant. For incentive stock options and nonstatutory stock options, the option price shall
not be less than 100% of the fair market value on the day of grant. If at the time we grant an option, the optionee directly or by attribution owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all our classes of stock, the option price is
required to be at least 110% of the fair market value on the day of grant. Options granted typically vest over a 4-year period but may be granted with different vesting terms. Upon adoption of the 2015 Plan, no new awards or grants are permitted

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying stock options before our IPO was determined by our
Board of Directors. Prior to our IPO in August 2015, because there was no public market for our common stock, the Board of Directors determined fair value of the common stock at the time of grant of the option by considering a number of objective
and subjective factors including important developments in our operations, valuations performed by an independent third party, sales of convertible preferred stock, actual operating results and financial performance, the conditions in the
biotechnology industry and the economy in general, the stock price performance and volatility of comparable public companies, and the lack of liquidity of our common stock, among other factors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In determining the fair value of the options granted, we used the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model and assumptions discussed below.
Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Expected Term</I>&#151;Our expected term
represents the period that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term). We have very limited historical
information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for our stock option grants.<I> </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Expected Volatility</I>&#151;Prior to the IPO in August 2015, we were privately held and did not have any trading history for our common
stock; accordingly, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. When selecting comparable
publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies on which we have based our expected stock price volatility, we selected companies with comparable characteristics to us, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with
historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares during the equivalent period of the
calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. Sufficient trading history does not yet
exist for our common stock, therefore the estimate of expected volatility is based on the volatility of the selected companies with similar products under development, market, size and other factors as well as the historical volatility of our own
common stock since we began trading subsequent to its IPO in August 2015.<I> </I></P>

December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors modified one of the corporate operating milestones, which resulted in two of the corporate operating milestones being achieved; accordingly, an aggregate of 94,502 shares
underlying options and 49,643 shares of restricted stock associated with these two milestones vested and, as a result, $1.5 million of compensation cost was recognized for the performance-contingent awards, including $1.4 million of compensation
cost related to the modified corporate operating milestone. One of the remaining two corporate operating milestones was not met within the timeframe required for achievement during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016; accordingly, 47,500 shares
underlying options were forfeited and 24,821 shares of restricted stock associated with the milestone were repurchased by us. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, unvested performance-contingent awards included 30,710 shares underlying options and 24,821

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;9, 2015, our Board of Directors granted a market-condition award to our Chief Executive Officer of 99,285 shares of restricted
common stock, with a purchase price of $3.40 per share, which the Board of Directors determined was the fair market value on the grant date. The market-condition award does not vest until our market capitalization (determined based on the number of
shares of common stock outstanding multiplied by the closing market price for our common stock as reported on NASDAQ) exceeds at least $2.0 billion for 20 consecutive trading days on or before the date twenty-four (24)&nbsp;months after the closing
of our IPO. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of the market-condition award of $0.70 was determined on the grant date utilizing a lattice model with an
expected term of 2.4 years. In August 2015, we began to recognize compensation costs for this award concurrent with the closing of our IPO. </P>

July 2015, we adopted the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the &#147;2015 ESPP&#148;). Under the 2015 ESPP our employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the
stock at the beginning of the offering period or at the end of each applicable purchase period. The 2015 ESPP provides for offering periods of six months in duration. The purchase periods end on either January&nbsp;31st or July&nbsp;31st.
Contributions under the 2015 ESPP are limited to a maximum of 15% of an employee&#146;s eligible compensation. ESPP purchases are settled with common stock from the ESPP&#146;s previously authorized and available pool of shares. During 2016, 65,252
shares were issued under the ESPP for $1.0 million. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income, if any, the amount and timing
of which are uncertain. We have established a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from its net operating loss carryforwards and other
deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased approximately $34.0 million, $16.7 million, and $8.9 million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance is mainly
related to the increase in net operating loss carryforwards incurred during the respective taxable years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At December&nbsp;31, 2016, we
had net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of $126.3&nbsp;million which are available to offset future taxable income, if any, through 2036 and net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $151.8
million which are available to offset future taxable income, if any, through 2036. The net deferred tax asset above does not include any amounts attributable to excess stock option deductions because the Company has no taxable income to offset such
deductions and as such, they are not recognized for book purposes. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had research and development/orphan drug tax credit carryforwards of approximately $13.8 million and $2.1 million available to reduce future taxable
income, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in 2031, and the state credits carryforward indefinitely. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In general, if we experience a greater than 50 percentage point aggregate change in ownership over a three-year period (a Section&nbsp;382
ownership change), utilization of our pre-change NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code (California has similar laws). The annual limitation generally is determined by multiplying
the value of our stock at the time of such ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Such limitations may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL carryforwards before utilization. We have not
utilized any NOL carryovers through December&nbsp;31, 2016. In addition, our deferred tax assets are subject to full valuation allowance, and thus no benefit for deferred tax assets are recorded on our books. Our ability to use the remaining NOL
carryforwards may be further limited if we experience a Section&nbsp;382 ownership change as a result of future changes in our stock ownership. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">No liability related to uncertain tax positions is recorded on the consolidated financial statements. All uncertain tax positions are recorded
as a reduction to our deferred tax asset in accordance with ASU 2013-11. It is our policy to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of other expense and interest expense, respectively, as necessary. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;) in Internal Control &#150; 2013 Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of
our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, for emerging growth companies. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="rom335897_14"></A>Item&nbsp;9B. </B><B><I>Other Information</I></B><B></B><B>
