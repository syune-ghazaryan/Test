At the close of business on the Record Date, 87,519,910 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, $0.001&nbsp;par value per&nbsp;share, were issued and outstanding. If you were a stockholder of record on that date, you will be entitled to vote all

each proposal considered at the Annual Meeting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>What constitutes a quorum? What are broker non-votes? What are advisory votes? </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the common stock
outstanding on the Record Date will constitute a quorum, permitting the Company to conduct its business at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, 87,519,910 shares of common stock, representing the same number of votes, were outstanding. Thus,
the presence of the holders of common stock representing at least 43,759,956 shares will be required to establish a quorum. The presence of a quorum will be determined by the Inspector of Elections (the &#147;Inspector&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Proxies received but marked as abstentions, as well as &#147;broker non-votes,&#148; will be included in the calculation of the number
of&nbsp;shares considered to be present at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes occur when a holder of&nbsp;shares in &#147;street name&#148; does not give instructions to the broker or nominee holding the&nbsp;shares as to how to vote on
&#147;non-routine&#148; matters. Under the rules and interpretations of the New York Stock Exchange (the &#147;NYSE&#148;), &#147;non-routine&#148; matters are matters that may substantively affect the rights or privileges of stockholders, such as
mergers, stockholder proposals and elections of directors, even if not contested. In addition, as required by Section&nbsp;957 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, advisory votes on executive compensation and on
the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation are non-routine matters for which brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote&nbsp;shares held by account holders. Only ratification of our independent registered public accounting
firm under Proposal Five is considered a routine matter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The votes on Proposals Two and Three are advisory. Neither the approval nor the
disapproval of Proposal Two or the outcome of the vote on Proposal Three will be binding on the Company or the Board of Directors and neither will create or imply any change to the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors. However, the Company and
the Board of Directors will consider the results of the advisory votes on Proposal Two and Proposal Three in making future decisions about compensation of the Company&#146;s named executive officers and frequency of future advisory votes on the
compensation paid to the Company&#146;s named executive officers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>How do I vote? </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you complete and properly sign the accompanying proxy card and return it to the Company, it will be voted as you direct. If you are a
registered stockholder (that is, if you hold your stock in certificate form and attend the Annual Meeting), you may deliver your completed proxy card in person. &#147;Street name&#148; stockholders who wish to vote at the Annual Meeting will need to
obtain a proxy form from the institution that holds their&nbsp;shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The cost of solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company.
The Company will reimburse expenses incurred by brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of&nbsp;shares in forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners. To assist in soliciting proxies (votes), the Company may retain
a professional proxy solicitation firm, at an approximate cost of $10,000. Proxies also may be solicited by certain of the Company&#146;s directors, officers and regular employees, without additional compensation, personally, by telephone or by
other appropriate means. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Can I vote by telephone or electronically? </I></B></P>

telephone or electronically is 11:59&nbsp;p.m., Eastern Time, on May&nbsp;21, 2017. </P>

directors will then serve in succeeding terms of three years and until a successor is duly elected and qualified. Officers of the Company serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors. There are no family relationships among the Company&#146;s
directors and executive officers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of office for directors Kevin C. Gorman,&nbsp;Ph.D., Gary A. Lyons and

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board of Directors believes that the proposed increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Amended
2011 Plan will allow the Company to attract and retain valuable employees and continue to provide its employees, consultants and directors with a proprietary interest in the Company. In particular, the Company anticipates doubling its number of
employees in 2017 as a result of receiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the Company&#146;s first product, INGREZZA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">TM</SUP> (valbenazine) capsules, which occurred in April 2017. The
Company is commercializing INGREZZA in the United States. Within the Company, equity awards foster an ownership culture and are a critical tool for driving stockholder value and for recruiting, retaining and motivating employees. The Company grants
annual equity awards to employees as an incentive to retain its work force and remain competitive. The terms of the Company&#146;s annual equity awards and the Company&#146;s employee policies are designed to align employee and stockholder
interests. The Company grants equity awards to a broad group of employees and such awards constitute a significant component of the Company&#146;s employees&#146; total compensation. The Company&#146;s equity awards contain long-term vesting,
performance-based vesting, and provisions designed to encourage employees to focus on the Company&#146;s long-term goals and success. If our stockholders do not approve the Amended 2011 Plan, the Company strongly believes that it will be unable to
successfully use equity as part of its compensation program, as most of its competitors in the industry do, putting the Company at a significant disadvantage and compromising its ability to enhance stockholder value. </P>

Code. The 2011 Plan also authorizes the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance stock awards and other stock awards (collectively &#147;stock awards&#148;) to our
employees, directors and consultants. The 2011 Plan also provides that certain nonstatutory stock options will be automatically granted to non-employee directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, as described below. </P>

outstanding under the Amended 2011 Plan. If any surviving corporation declines to assume stock awards outstanding under the Amended 2011 Plan or to substitute similar stock awards, then, with respect to participants whose service with the Company
has not terminated prior to the time of such corporate transaction, the vesting and the time during which such stock awards may be exercised will be accelerated in full, and all outstanding stock awards will terminate if the participant does not
exercise such stock awards at or prior to the corporate transaction. With respect to any stock awards that are held by other participants that terminated service with the Company prior to the corporate transaction, the vesting and exercisability
provisions of such stock awards will not be accelerated and such stock awards will terminate if not exercised prior to the corporate transaction. </P>

2011 Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason. Unless sooner terminated, the Amended 2011 Plan will terminate on February&nbsp;20, 2021.&nbsp;However, the Amended 2011 Plan requires stockholder approval for any amendment to the
Amended 2011 Plan to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations. No action by the Board of Directors or stockholders may impair any award previously granted under the Amended 2011 Plan without the consent of the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Incentive Stock Options</I></B>. An optionee who is granted an incentive stock option does not recognize taxable income at the time the
option is granted or upon its exercise, although the exercise is an adjustment item for alternative minimum tax purposes and may subject the optionee to the alternative minimum tax. Upon a disposition of the shares more than two years after grant of
the option and one year after exercise of the option, any gain or loss is treated as long-term capital gain or loss. If these holding periods are not satisfied, the optionee recognizes ordinary income at the time of disposition equal to the
difference between the exercise price and the lesser of (i)&nbsp;the excess of the stock&#146;s fair market value on the date of exercise over the exercise price, or (ii)&nbsp;the participant&#146;s actual gain, if any, on the purchase and sale. Any
gain or loss recognized on such a premature disposition of the shares in excess of the amount treated as ordinary income is treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on the holding period. A different rule for measuring
ordinary income upon such a premature disposition may apply if the optionee is also an officer, director or 10% stockholder of the Company. Unless limited by Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, the Company is entitled to a deduction in the same amount
as the ordinary income recognized by the optionee. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Nonstatutory Stock Options</I></B>. An optionee does not recognize any taxable income at
the time he or she is granted a nonstatutory stock option. Upon exercise, the optionee recognizes taxable income generally measured by the excess of the then fair market value of the shares over the exercise price. Any taxable income recognized in
connection with an option exercise by an employee of the Company is subject to tax withholding by the Company. Unless limited by Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, the Company is entitled to a deduction in the same amount as the ordinary income
recognized by the optionee. Upon a disposition of such shares by the optionee, any difference between the sale price and the optionee&#146;s exercise price, to the extent not recognized as taxable income as provided above, is treated as long-term or
short-term capital gain or loss, depending on the holding period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Stock Appreciation Rights</I></B>. No taxable income is realized
upon the receipt of a stock appreciation right. Upon exercise of the stock appreciation right, the fair market value of the shares (or cash in lieu of shares) received is recognized as ordinary income to the participant in the year of such exercise.
Generally, with respect to employees, we are required to withhold from the payment made on exercise of the stock appreciation right or from regular wages or supplemental wage payments an amount based on the ordinary income recognized. Subject to the
requirement of reasonableness, Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code and the satisfaction of a reporting obligation, we will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Restricted Stock Awards</I></B>. For federal income tax purposes, if an individual is granted a restricted stock award, the recipient
generally will recognize taxable ordinary income equal to the excess of the common stock&#146;s fair market value over the purchase price, if any. However, to the extent the common stock is subject to certain types of restrictions, such as a
repurchase right in favor of the Company, the taxable event will be delayed until the vesting restrictions lapse unless the recipient makes a valid election under Section&nbsp;83(b) of the Code. If the recipient makes a valid election under
Section&nbsp;83(b) of the Code with respect to restricted stock, the recipient generally will recognize ordinary income at the date of acquisition of the restricted stock in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the fair market value of
the shares at that date over the purchase price for the restricted stock. If, however, a valid Section&nbsp;83(b) election is not made by the recipient, the recipient will generally recognize ordinary income when the restrictions on the shares of
restricted stock lapse, in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares at the date such restrictions lapse over the purchase price for the restricted stock. With respect to employees, the Company is generally
required to withhold from regular wages or supplemental wage payments an amount based on the ordinary income recognized. Generally, the Company will be entitled (subject to the requirement of reasonableness, the provisions of Section&nbsp;162(m) of
the Code and the satisfaction of a tax reporting obligation) to a business expense deduction equal to the taxable ordinary income realized by the recipient. Upon disposition of the common stock, the recipient will recognize a capital gain or loss
equal to the difference between the selling price and the sum of the amount paid for such common stock, if any, plus any amount recognized as ordinary income upon acquisition (or the lapse of restrictions) of the common stock. Such gain or loss will
be long-term or short-term depending on how long the common stock was held. Slightly different rules may apply to recipients who are subject to Section&nbsp;16(b) of the Exchange Act. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Restricted Stock Unit Awards</I></B>. No taxable income is recognized upon receipt of a restricted stock unit award. The participant
will recognize ordinary income in the year in which the shares subject to that unit are actually issued to the participant in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of issuance. The participant and the Company will be
required to satisfy certain tax withholding requirements applicable to such income. Subject to the requirement of reasonableness, Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code and the satisfaction of a tax reporting obligation, we will be entitled to an income
tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant at the time the shares are issued. In general, the deduction will be allowed for the taxable year in which such ordinary income is recognized by the participant. </P>

Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, compensation attributable to stock options will qualify as performance-based compensation, provided that: (1)&nbsp;the stock award plan contains a per-employee limitation on the number of shares for which awards may
be granted during a specified period; (2)&nbsp;the per-employee limitation is approved by the stockholders; (3)&nbsp;the stock award is granted by a compensation committee comprised solely of &#147;outside directors&#148;; and (4)&nbsp;the exercise

stock unit awards and other stock awards may qualify as performance-based compensation under the Treasury regulations only if: (1)&nbsp;the stock award is granted by a compensation committee comprised solely of &#147;outside directors&#148;;
(2)&nbsp;the stock award is earned (typically through vesting) only upon the achievement of an objective performance goal established in writing by the compensation committee while the outcome is substantially uncertain; (3)&nbsp;the compensation
committee certifies in writing prior to the earning of the stock award that the performance goal has been satisfied; and (4)&nbsp;prior to the earning of the stock award, stockholders have approved the material terms of the stock award (including
the class of employees eligible for such stock award, the business criteria on which the performance goal is based, and the maximum amount (or formula used to calculate the amount) payable upon attainment of the performance goal). The Amended 2011
Plan has been designed to permit the compensation committee to grant stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and other stock awards and performance cash awards which will qualify as &#147;performance-based compensation.&#148;

strategy and create long-term value for our stockholders. Consistent with our goal of attracting, motivating and retaining a high-caliber executive team, our executive compensation program is designed to pay for performance. We utilize compensation
elements that meaningfully align our NEOs&#146; interests with those of our stockholders to create long-term value. As such, a significant portion of our CEO&#146;s and other executive officers&#146; compensation is &#147;at risk&#148;,
performance-based compensation, in the form of long-term equity awards, and annual cash incentives that are only earned if we achieve multiple corporate metrics. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

executive compensation program continues to align executive pay with stockholder interests and provides competitive pay that encourages retention and effectively incentivizes performance of
talented NEOs and executives. Accordingly, the Committee determined not to make any significant changes to our programs as a result of the vote. The Committee will continue to consider the outcome of our say-on-pay votes and our stockholders&#146;
views when making future compensation decisions for the NEOs and executives. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Compensation Philosophy and Overall Compensation Determination Process
</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that in order to create value for our stockholders, it is critical to attract, motivate and retain key executive talent by
providing competitive compensation packages. Accordingly, we design our executive compensation programs to attract, motivate and retain executives with the skills and expertise to execute our business plans, and reward those executives fairly over
time for actions consistent with creating long-term stockholder value. The market for talented individuals in the life sciences industry is highly competitive. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our compensation philosophy for executive officers provides that cash compensation should be structured such that at least one-third of each
executive officer&#146;s total cash compensation, consisting of base salary and target cash incentives, is at risk and dependent upon the Company&#146;s performance. Non-cash long-term equity compensation for executive officers is generally a
combination of performance-based and time-based vesting, and is designed to motivate executive officers to increase long-term stockholder value as well as reward and retain key employees. The Committee believes that this approach provides an
appropriate blend of short-term and long-term incentives to maximize stockholder value. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The implementation of the compensation philosophy
is carried out under the supervision of the Committee. The Committee uses the services of an independent compensation consultant who is retained by, and reports directly to, the Committee. Management, under guidelines and procedures approved by the
Committee, determines the compensation of our non-executive officer employees. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the early part of each year, the Committee, without the
presence of our Chief Executive Officer, deliberates and makes decisions regarding the base salary, target cash incentives and long-term equity award components of compensation to be awarded to our Chief Executive Officer for the new fiscal year, as
well as performance-based compensation payouts for the prior fiscal year. In setting compensation for our other NEOs, the Committee solicits the input of our Chief Executive Officer, who recommends to the Committee the base salary, target cash
incentives and long-term equity award components of compensation to be awarded to our NEOs for the new fiscal year, as well as performance-based compensation payouts for the prior fiscal year. The Committee remains solely responsible for making the
final decisions on compensation for all of our NEOs. Our NEOs are not present during discussions of their compensation packages nor do they participate in approving any portion of their own compensation packages. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Chief Executive Officer annually reviews the performance of each NEO (other than himself) and discusses these performance reviews with the
Committee. These recommendations reflect his consideration of the market data, the performance of each NEO, internal pay equity among individuals (including qualifications and contributions to meeting our corporate objectives), criticality and scope
of job function and our Chief Executive Officer&#146;s extensive industry experience. The Committee reviews and considers the market data, our Chief Executive Officer&#146;s recommendations on specific pay levels for each NEO and Radford&#146;s
recommendations on compensation policy determinations for the executive officer group, and also reviews internal pay equity among individuals and positions, criticality and scope of job function, retention risk, Company performance and individual
performance (including qualifications and contributions to meeting our corporate objectives), total targeted and historical compensation for each individual NEO and any other factors the Committee determines important. The Committee uses all of
these factors to set the compensation of our NEOs at levels that the Committee considers to be competitive and appropriate for each NEO, using the Committee&#146;s professional experience and judgment. </P>

performance of each executive officer for the prior year and peer group compensation data are reviewed by the Committee, and base salary adjustments, cash incentive payouts, following year targets and annual equity grants are discussed and approved.
Also during the first quarter of the year, Company-wide performance goals for the then current year are finalized by the Committee and the Board of Directors. At mid-year meetings, the Committee reviews the Company&#146;s compensation philosophy,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When developing a proposed list of our peer group companies to be used in connection with making compensation decisions for 2016, Radford
reexamined our compensation philosophy and peer group and recommended changes to our 2015 peer group company list to reflect our growth, market capitalization and the stage of our commercial development.&nbsp;Radford suggested biopharmaceutical
companies that were late stage pre-commercial (Phase III or recently commercial companies with minimal revenue of less than $100 million), had market values of approximately one half (0.5x) to two-and-a-half (2.5x)&nbsp;our market capitalization at
the time (resulting in a range of between $2 billion to $10 billion in market capitalization) and had headcounts of generally between 50 to 300.&nbsp;Based on these criteria, Radford recommended, and our Committee approved eliminating Aegerion
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc., NewLink Genetics Corporation, Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., PTC Therapeutics, Inc., Relypsa, Inc., Sangamo
BioSciences, Inc. and Xoma Corporation (which no longer met the criteria described above), KYTHERA Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Receptos, Inc. and Synageva BioPharma Corp. (which were acquired since the 2015 peer group company list was approved) and
adding Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma, Inc., Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Puma Biotechnology, Inc. and Ultragenyx
Pharmaceutical Inc. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>2016 Peer Group</I>. Based on these parameters, in November 2015 our Committee approved the following companies as
our peer group for 2016: ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Clovis Oncology, Inc., Dyax, Corp., Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ionis
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma, Inc., Novavax, Inc., Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Puma Biotechnology, Inc., Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., TESARO, Inc. and Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. In determining executive
compensation for 2016, the Committee reviewed data from this group of peer companies.&nbsp;At the time of approval of our 2016 peer group, our Company was in the 76<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the peer group
for market capitalization and 60<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP>&nbsp;percentile of the peer group for revenue. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
early 2016, Radford completed an assessment of executive compensation based on the 2016 peer group to inform the Committee&#146;s determinations of executive compensation for 2016. This market data was compiled from multiple sources, including:
(i)&nbsp;the 2016 peer group companies&#146; publicly disclosed information, or public peer data and (ii)&nbsp;data from public biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the Radford Global Life Sciences Survey that had market values between $2
billion and $10 billion. The components of the market data were based on the availability of sufficient comparative data for an executive officer&#146;s position. The general survey data and the public peer data, collectively referred to in this
proxy statement together as market data, were reviewed by the Committee, with the assistance of Radford, and used as one reference point, in addition to other factors, in setting our executive officers&#146; compensation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Committee generally reviews total direct compensation, comprising both target cash compensation and equity compensation, against the
market data described above primarily to ensure that our executive compensation program as a whole is positioned competitively to attract and retain the highest caliber executive officers and that the total direct compensation opportunity for the
executive officer group is aligned with our corporate objectives and strategic needs.&nbsp;The Committee does not have a specific target compensation level for the NEOs; rather, the Committee reviews a range of market data reference points
(generally at the 25<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP>, 50<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP>&nbsp;and 75<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP>&nbsp;percentiles of the market data) with
respect to total direct compensation, total target cash compensation (including both base salary and the target annual cash incentive) and equity compensation (valued based on an approximation of grant date fair value). In making compensation
determinations, the Committee considers a variety of factors, which may include market data and a particular executive officer&#146;s experience, overall qualifications and criticality of skills to the future performance of our Company. </P>

The Committee considers each component of compensation independently and each component in the context of each executive officer&#146;s total compensation. Compensation for our NEOs currently consists of three key elements that are designed to
reward performance in a simple and straightforward manner: base salaries, annual performance-based cash incentives and long-term equity awards, which generally include restricted stock unit awards (&#147;RSUs&#148;) and stock options, which both
vest based on continued service over time, and performance restricted stock units (&#147;PRSUs&#148;), which vest upon achievement of key corporate metrics that we believe will create shareholder value. The purpose and key characteristics of each of
these elements are summarized below. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

table below. The Committee determined these three types of equity awards provided the appropriate balance of long-term incentives for our executive officers. Specifically, PRSUs that vest based
on objectively measurable performance goals focus executives on achieving specific longer-term Company performance goals and increasing stockholder value, and RSUs that vest over time provide tangible value to executive officers and serve as an
incentive and retention tool during a difficult operating or volatile business environment, while still being tied to our stockholder value. It is the Committee&#146;s view that stock options are inherently performance oriented because the executive
realizes no value from stock options unless and until the Company&#146;s stock price increases over the strike price. The Committee believes it is important to evaluate the equity award mix each year to determine what types of equity awards should
be granted. For example, in February 2017 the Committee did not award any performance-vesting PRSUs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In setting the mix of the three
types of equity awards for 2016, the Committee determined that a substantial portion of the equity grants should consist of awards that vest based on our performance (in the form of specific and measurable performance goals), in addition to
continued service over time. The mix between the three types of awards were determined based on market data of the equity award practices of peer group companies provided by the Committee&#146;s consultant, with the aim that performance-based awards
comprise a meaningful portion of each executive officer&#146;s total award. Accordingly, the Committee structured the mix of equity such that the baseline award of options and RSUs would generally deliver value, as determined by the Black-Scholes
value of stock options and the value of RSUs as if they were fully vested, to NEOs between the 50<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> and 75<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentiles with PRSUs providing
the opportunity for above-market pay if earned. The opportunity for higher performance-based compensation opportunity reflects our commitment to pay for performance, with compensation above the median of our peers for exceptional performance and
compensation below this level if our performance goals are not reached. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

of Directors, determined with respect to the February&nbsp;5, 2016 equity grants that the use of both stock options which vest monthly, on a pro-rata basis, over a four-year period and RSUs which vest annually, on a pro-rata basis, over a four-year
period were the appropriate equity compensation vehicles. The Committee and Board of Directors believe that the long-term equity based compensation awards closely align stockholder and management interests. </P>

set the PRSU award goals to be rigorous and ultimately serve to align management and our stockholders&#146; interests. The 2016 PRSUs vest upon 1)&nbsp;obtaining positive pivotal clinical trial data for the treatment of Tourette syndrome with
valbenazine as determined by the Committee and 2) the FDA&#146;s acceptance of the Company&#146;s NDA submission of valbenazine for the treatment of Tourette syndrome. Vesting of these awards would represent the culmination of several years of
effort, including success in clinical development and the successful navigation of the regulatory submission process. If the vesting criteria are achieved, we believe significant stockholder value will be created. Additionally, these PRSUs have a
limited term of four years for the Company to achieve the objectives required for vesting. The individual PRSUs either fully vest upon completion of the corporate objectives within such four-year period or never vest. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2017, we adopted a clawback policy, even though the SEC has not yet issued final rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act requirement. Our policy currently provides that, in the event that (i)&nbsp;we are required to prepare an accounting restatement for any fiscal quarter or year due to our material noncompliance with any financial
reporting requirement and (ii)&nbsp;it is determined that misconduct contributed to the noncompliance that resulted in the obligation to restate our financial statements, we may take action to recover from any officer whose misconduct contributed to
the noncompliance which resulted in the obligation to restate our financial statements, the incentive compensation that was paid or vested to such officer during the twelve-month period preceding the restatement obligation. We will also comply with
the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and will modify our policy to the extent required by law once the SEC adopts final regulations on the subject. </P>

only deduct up to $1.0&nbsp;million of the compensation we pay to named executive officers each taxable year unless such compensation is &#147;performance-based compensation&#148; within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code. The Committee has
determined that any gain related to the exercise of a stock option granted under any of our stockholder-approved stock option plans with an exercise price at least equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant qualifies under the
Internal Revenue Code as performance-based compensation and therefore is not subject to the $1.0&nbsp;million limitation. However, deductibility is not the sole factor used by the Committee in ascertaining appropriate levels or manner of
compensation and corporate objectives may not necessarily align with the requirements for full deductibility under Section&nbsp;162(m). Accordingly, we may enter into executive officer compensation arrangements under which payments are not
deductible under Section&nbsp;162(m). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;409A </I></B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The elements of director compensation consist of annual cash retainers and equity awards, as well as customary and usual expense reimbursement
in attending Company meetings. In an effort to align the long-term interests of our stockholders and non-employee directors, the mix of cash and equity compensation has historically been, and is currently, weighted more heavily to equity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2016, the Board and the Company&#146;s stockholders approved certain annual limits on compensation to be paid to the Company&#146;s
non-employee directors. The aggregate value of all compensation granted or paid, as applicable, to any individual for service as a non-employee director will not exceed $1,250,000 in total value during any year. In addition, the aggregate value of
the initial option grant or other similar stock awards granted under the 2011 Plan or otherwise to any individual for service as a non-employee director upon or in connection with his or her initial election or appointment to the Board will not
exceed $2,000,000 in total value. The Board has the authority to make exceptions to these limits in extraordinary circumstances, in its discretion, provided that any non-employee director who is granted or paid such additional compensation may not
participate in the decision to grant or pay such additional compensation. No exceptions were made in 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each year, our Committee
reviews non-employee director compensation levels with its compensation consultant and recommends to our Board, as it deems appropriate, changes to such compensation levels. Our director compensation for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 is described
below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Non-Employee Director Compensation for Fiscal 2016 </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Non-employee directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with performing their duties as directors of the Company. For 2016,
directors who are not employees of the Company received a $50,000 annual retainer. The Company provided the Chairman of the Board, William H. Rastetter, an additional $30,000, making his total annual cash retainer $80,000. In addition to the cash
compensation set forth above, the Chairman of the Audit Committee received an additional $20,000 annual cash retainer. The Chairman of the Compensation Committee received an additional $20,000 annual cash retainer. The Chairman of the
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee received an additional $9,000 annual cash retainer. The Chairman of the Technology and Medical Sciences Committee received an additional $9,000 annual cash retainer. Each other director who was a member of
the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee or the Science and Medical Technology Committee received an additional annual cash retainer of $12,000, $12,000, $5,000 and $5,000, respectively, for each
Committee on which he or she served. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, for 2016, each non-employee director received a grant of a nonstatutory stock option
to purchase 15,000&nbsp;shares of the Company&#146;s common stock (except that the Chairman of the Board received an option to purchase 18,000&nbsp;shares) at the 2016 Annual Meeting. The options granted to non-employee directors have exercise
prices equal to the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of the grant, are subject to a ten-year term and vest monthly over the one-year period following the date of grant. </P>

of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld by law (or such lesser amount as may be necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes);

made in accordance with Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. Consistent with Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise providing services to the Company. The Board is
authorized to make deferrals of Awards and determine when, and in what annual percentages, Participants may receive payments, including lump sum payments, following the Participant&#146;s termination of Continuous Service, and implement such other
