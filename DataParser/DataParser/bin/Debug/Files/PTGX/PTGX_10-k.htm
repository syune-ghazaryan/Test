<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary technology platform focused on discovering and developing peptide-based
new chemical entities (&#147;NCEs&#148; ) to address significant unmet medical needs. Our primary focus is on developing first-in-class oral peptide drugs that specifically target the same biological pathways also targeted by currently marketed
injectable antibody drugs. Compared to injectable antibody drugs, our oral peptides offer targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal (&#147;GI&#148;) tissue compartment, potential for improved safety due to minimal exposure in the blood, improved
convenience and compliance due to oral delivery and the opportunity for earlier introduction of targeted therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (&#147;IBD&#148;). Our initial lead product candidates, PTG-100 and PTG-200, are based on this approach
and we believe they have the potential to transform the existing treatment paradigm for IBD, a GI disease consisting primarily of ulcerative colitis (&#147;UC&#148;), and Crohn&#146;s disease (&#147;CD&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PTG-100 and PTG-200 are derived from our proprietary peptide technology platform. Peptide therapeutics represent a substantial and growing
therapeutic class with more than 60 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) approved drugs. Our platform enables us to discover novel, structurally constrained peptides that retain certain key advantages of both oral and small molecule
and injectable antibody drugs, while overcoming many of their limitations as therapeutic agents. Constrained peptides are rigid, well-folded structures typically formed by disulfide bonds that alleviate the fundamental instability inherent in
traditional peptides, which cannot be delivered orally. Further, these constrained peptides are designed to bind to biological targets, including protein-protein interactions (&#147;PPI&#148;) targets, which are typically approached by antibodies
since small molecules cannot bind effectively to these targets. It is estimated that up to 80% of all potential disease targets are not amenable to drug development by small molecules and have therefore traditionally been approached by injectable
antibody drugs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our novel peptides have potential applicability in a wide range of therapeutic areas in addition to GI diseases. Our
first product candidate beyond IBD is PTG-300, an injectable hepcidin mimetic, which is currently in pre-clinical development with completion of Investigational New Drug (&#147;IND&#148;) enabling studies expected by the end of the first half of
2017. A hepcidin mimetic is a peptide that mimics the function of the natural hormone, hepcidin. PTG-300 has potential utility for the treatment of iron overload disorders, such as <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#098;</FONT>-Thalassemia,
hereditary hemochromatosis (&#147;HH&#148;) and sickle cell disease (&#147;SCD&#148;), each of which may qualify PTG-300 for orphan drug designation. </P>

potential as an oral, alpha-4-beta-7 (&#147;<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>4<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#098;</FONT>7&#148;) integrin-specific antagonist for the treatment of IBD. The
<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>4<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#098;</FONT>7 integrin is considered to be one of the most GI-specific biological targets for IBD. It is a cell surface protein present on T cells that plays an
important role in the trafficking of T cells to the GI tissue compartment by binding to MAdCAM-1, an extracellular protein that resides mostly in the GI vasculature. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are leveraging several factors to inform and guide the clinical development of PTG-100 for the treatment of IBD. First, PTG-100 shares the
same <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>4<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#098;</FONT>7 integrin target as the injectable antibody drug vedolizumab, marketed as Entyvio<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, for the
treatment of moderate-to-severe UC and CD. Second, we utilized pharmacodynamic (&#147;PD&#148;) biomarker assays similar to those described in scientific publications used with Entyvio<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and
other antibodies in development as indicators of target engagement to establish proof-of-concept (&#147;POC&#148;) in our Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial with PTG-100. These PD data include increases in receptor occupancy and decreases in receptor
expression. We believe that we can utilize published information describing the development and regulatory path of Entyvio<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and other approved antibody drugs for IBD to help inform the design
of our clinical development studies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have completed extensive pre-clinical studies of PTG-100 in which we established pharmacological
POC, including effects on T cell trafficking and mucosal healing similar to comparator <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>4<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#098;</FONT>7 rodent antibody, DATK-32. Following the submission and approval of
a Clinical Trial Notification (&#147;CTN&#148;) in Australia in December 2015, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial, comprised of three components: a single ascending dose (&#147;SAD&#148;) and multiple ascending dose (&#147;MAD&#148;) component,
each of which evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics (&#147;PK&#148;), and PD-based POC in healthy subjects, using an oral liquid formulation of PTG-100. The Phase 1 clinical trial was completed in June 2016. Dose escalation proceeded up to 1,000 mg,
the highest dose tested in the study for both single and multiple dosing. There were no serious adverse events reported in the Phase 1 clinical trial, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. All reported adverse events were of mild to
moderate severity. There were no dose-dependent increases observed for any adverse events. The most frequent adverse events reported by subjects on PTG-100 were headache and upper respiratory tract infection. These events were also observed in
subjects who took placebo. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We initiated a global Phase 2b randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled dose-finding clinical trial in
the fourth quarter of 2016 to assess safety and efficacy of PTG-100 in moderate-to-severe UC patients. We anticipate that the trial will enroll approximately 240 subjects at approximately 100 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe (Western,
Central, and Eastern), Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The primary objectives of our Phase 2b clinical trial are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PTG-100 and its efficacy in the induction of remission in subjects with moderate-to-severe
UC. Secondary objectives are to select PTG-100 induction doses for continued development, to characterize PTG-100 plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamic responses, and to evaluate any immunogenicity over 12 weeks. The trial will include subjects
who have had prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (&#147;TNF-<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>&#148;) inhibitors and subjects who have not been treated with biologics. Subjects will be randomized to one of four dose arms
(150mg/300mg/900mg PTG-100 or placebo) for 12 weeks of once-daily oral dosing, followed by four weeks of safety follow-up. An interim futility analysis is expected to be performed in the second half of 2017, and if futility criteria are not met, one
or two PTG-100 doses will be selected for continued randomization of the remaining subjects. We expect to complete the study and report top-line data in the second half of 2018. We expect that this trial will support end-of-Phase 2 meetings with
global health authorities and enable the initiation of a Phase 3 pivotal program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The primary endpoints are consistent with those used in
the clinical development of previously approved drugs for UC. The trial is statistically powered to detect a clinically meaningful difference in induction of remission in subjects with moderate-to-severe UC who are treated with PTG-100 compared to
placebo. The evaluation of clinical remission is based on the Mayo Score, which is a well-established composite assessment that utilizes patient-reported outcomes and endoscopic improvement. Secondary efficacy endpoints will include

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our second oral, GI-restricted peptide product candidate is PTG-200, a potential first-in-class Interleukin-23 receptor (&#147;IL-23R&#148;)
specific antagonist for the treatment of IBD. Interleukin-23 (&#147;IL-23&#148;) is a member of the IL-12 family of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and is a protein that regulates inflammatory and immune function and plays a key role in the development
of IBD. By blocking the IL-23 receptor with PTG-200 in the GI tissue compartment, we expect to reduce inflammation while potentially minimizing the risk of systemic side effects due to its GI-restricted nature. The IL-23 pathway is targeted by the
IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist infused antibody drug ustekinumab, marketed as Stelara<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and moderate-to-severe CD. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have completed pre-clinical POC studies for PTG-200, started IND-enabling studies, and plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2017.

peptide hormone critical for regulating iron homeostasis. However, hepcidin has significant stability, potency and solubility limitations. We have discovered and developed PTG-300 as a stable, soluble hepcidin mimetic that can potentially be more
potent and more amenable for weekly or less frequent subcutaneous delivery compared to hepcidin. We plan to complete IND-enabling studies by the end of the first half of 2017 and complete a Phase 1 clinical trial that will evaluate safety/
tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic proof-of-concept by the end of 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Additional Product Candidates.</I> We are

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before the FDA approval&nbsp;of antibody drugs, chemically synthesized oral small molecules were the standard-of-care for the treatment of many
diseases. However, small molecules are not capable of blocking most PPIs that underpin cellular processes frequently involved in numerous diseases. It is estimated that small molecules cannot be developed as drugs for the treatment of up to 80% of
all identified potential disease targets. With the availability of antibody drugs, targeted therapy for many PPI-driven diseases became feasible. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2015, six of the top ten selling U.S. drugs were antibody drugs. In 2013, all approved antibody drugs together generated approximately $75
billion in sales. More than 30 antibody drugs have now been approved by the FDA, including the IBD targeted therapy drugs Humira<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>,
Remicade<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, and Entyvio<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. </P>

conventional peptide therapeutics. In addition, our platform represents a major step forward in the evolution of peptides as therapeutics. Most of the more than 60 currently FDA approved peptides have unstructured shapes, leading to chemical and
biological stability limitations, which confine their use to injectable drugs. In contrast, our peptide technology platform allows us to identify constrained peptides that can serve as a starting point for discovery and development of oral,
selective, and potent peptides. The well-folded conformation in our constrained peptides is typically derived by disulfide bonds, a structural feature inherent in many naturally occurring peptides. For the IBD targets of interest, the size and
nature of our peptides is carefully selected and modified so as to acquire the desired potency and specificity, and also to restrict their presence to the GI tissue compartment when administered orally. These features translate to oral,
GI-restricted, selective and potent peptide drug candidates with specific advantages compared to antibody drugs: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Inflammatory bowel disease is a group of chronic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, consisting primarily
of UC and CD,&nbsp;and characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue and anemia.&nbsp;In UC, inflammation starts in the rectum and generally extends proximally in a continuous manner through the entire colon. In CD, the disease
most commonly affects the small intestine and the proximal large intestine. Both UC and CD have periods of various intensity and severity, and when a patient is symptomatic, the disease is considered to be in an active or flare stage. Approximately
25% of UC cases occur in persons before the age of 20. Furthermore, pediatric IBD is considered an orphan indication. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Market Overview </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to the Crohn&#146;s&nbsp;&amp; Colitis Foundation of America, there were an estimated 1.6&nbsp;million IBD patients in the United
States in 2013, an increase of approximately 200,000 patients since 2011. As many as 70,000 new cases of IBD are diagnosed in the United States each year. As of 2008, annual direct treatment costs for patients with IBD in the United States were
estimated to exceed $6.3 billion, while indirect costs such as missed work days were estimated to cost an additional $5.5 billion. In 2012, GlobalData estimated that the UC market reached approximately $4.2 billion and the CD market reached
approximately $3.2 billion, in each case across ten major markets: the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, China, and India. According to Global Data estimates, these markets are expected to grow at a
compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% to 5% over the ten years from 2012 to 2022. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>History of IBD Treatments </I></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sulfasalazine was discovered as the first non-targeted therapy for treatment of UC. Non-targeted therapies continued to evolve, including the
introduction of corticosteroids for treatment of moderate UC in the 1950s. Subsequently, the immunosuppressive drug mercaptopurine was identified for UC in the 1960s, azathiopurine was developed in the 1970s, followed by 5-aminosalicylic acid. While
these oral, non-targeted broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory agents and non-specific immunomodulators continue to be part of the IBD treatment paradigm, especially in mild-to-moderate IBD, these drugs are often ineffective, and corticosteroid and oral
immunosuppressive drugs may have significant and disabling adverse effects that limit their use. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Inducing and maintaining clinical remission is the primary goal of treatment for IBD patients. The current treatment paradigm for IBD is
considered a &#147;step-up&#148; approach. It involves a sequential &#147;step-up&#148; in treatment to more potent but higher risk therapies according to the level of severity of the patient&#146;s disease. Thus, targeted biologic therapies are
generally reserved for patients with moderate-to-severe disease who have failed to respond to non-targeted oral therapies including 5-ASA agents, corticosteroids and non-specific immunomodulators. As a result, only a portion of IBD patients
currently receive a targeted antibody therapy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For moderate-to-severe IBD patients, physicians may prescribe TNF<I>-</I><FONT
STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT> antibody drugs (e.g. Remicade<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> or Humira<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>) or Entyvio<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, an antibody drug inhibiting <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>4<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#098;</FONT>7 integrin, to induce and maintain clinical remission. Patients who are
transitioned to these targeted antibody drugs may fail to respond to treatment or lose response to some or all of these agents over time and may ultimately require surgery. Approximately 50% to 73% of CD and 65% of UC patients fail to reach
remission with TNF-<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT> antibodies.&nbsp;Furthermore, 30% to 40% of UC patients and approximately 40% of CD patients treated with TNF-<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT> antibody drugs stop
responding to these agents over time (secondary non-responders) at a rate of approximately 10% to 13%&nbsp;per year. Of the CD patients who initially benefit from TNF-<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT> antibody drugs, 25% to 40% of these
patients develop intolerable or serious adverse events or lose their response within the first year of therapy. Currently, a common approach for IBD patients with lack of efficacy or loss of response to
TNF-<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT> antibody drugs is to switch such patients to other TNF-<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT> antibody drugs. Although this is initially successful in 40% to 60% of patients, there remains a
lack of treatment options for patients who lose responses to multiple TNF<I>-</I><FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT> antibody drugs.&nbsp;Further, patient non-adherence with TNF-<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT> antibody
drugs in IBD has been reported to be between approximately 30% to 45% resulting in a greater need for hospitalization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The development of
new, potent and targeted therapies for IBD with oral delivery may potentially offer more effective treatment options for moderate-to-severe IBD patients. Furthermore, many clinicians are already advocating for an earlier introduction of targeted
therapeutics in IBD to reduce, replace or delay the use of corticosteroids and non-specific oral immunomodulators. This treatment approach is often referred to as a &#147;top-down&#148; approach as therapeutics that are currently at the top of the
&#147;step-up&#148; pyramid are moved down to earlier in the treatment paradigm (see Figure 1). We believe we are well-positioned to be leaders in this shift from &#147;step-up&#148; to &#147;top-down&#148; therapy. Our oral, GI-restricted, and

in UC patients in the Phase 2b clinical trial. In the mouse colitis model, RO and RE were correlated with <I>in vivo</I> efficacy that can be extrapolated to the blood RO and RE observed in healthy mice and cyno. These PD markers from mice and cyno
have specifically demonstrated increases in RO that peak at approximately 4 hours following a single dose and multiple doses (Figure&nbsp;3A), and decreases in RE after multiple doses in healthy mice (Figure 3B) and colitis mice. In translating the
pre-clinical observations into a clinical setting, we are focused on evaluating dose- and time-dependent trends in RO and RE in our Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial that can be benchmarked to the animal data to give us greater confidence in progressing

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Mechanism of Action and Rationale </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">IL-23 is a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines with pro-inflammatory and autoimmune properties. Cytokines are cell signaling proteins that
are released by cells and affect the behavior of other cells. Binding of the IL-23 ligand to the IL-23R receptor leads to an expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the mucosal autocrine cascade that is an important pathway of many
inflammatory diseases, including IBD. Furthermore, genetic analyses of IBD patients have implicated IL-23R mutations as a risk factor associated with susceptibility to IBD. The antagonist infused antibody drug ustekinumab (marketed as Stelara<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and moderate-to-severe CD) is a p40 antagonist antibody that inhibits both the IL-23 and IL-12 pathways. Next-generation IBD antibody drugs, such as
guselkumab, target the p19 subunit of the IL-23 ligand and are specific to the IL-23 pathway, which is believed to be an important driver of IBD pathology, while not blockading the IL-12 pathway. IL-12 is believed to be important in immune
surveillance against the development of infections and malignancies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the oral, GI-restricted nature of PTG-200 will allow
PTG-200 to be a potent inhibitor of the IL-23 pathway for the treatment of IBD. By targeting IL-23R with our GI-restricted oral IL-23R antagonist PTG-200, we believe PTG-200 will restore proper immune function in the GI tissue compartment where
there is active disease while minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. Several key cell types that reside in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (&#147;GALT&#148;), including T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and natural killer cells, increase their
expression of IL-23R during the progression of IBD. Therefore, the high concentrations of PTG-200 in GALT will facilitate access and binding to IL-23R expressed in the same tissue. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>PTG-200&#146;s Pre-Clinical Proof-of-Concept Studies </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PTG-200 potently inhibited binding of IL-23 to the IL-23 receptor in several biochemical (ELISA) and cell (transformed and primary) signaling
assays in a subnanomolar to low nanomolar concentration range sufficient to inhibit 50% of binding. PTG-200 exhibited greater than a 50,000-fold selectivity against other structurally similar receptors
(IL-12R<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#098;</FONT>1 and IL-6R) thereby potentially reducing the risk of off target interactions. In total, these drug properties provide evidence to characterize PTG-200 as a potential first-in-class orally stable
IL-23R-specific antagonist. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In PK studies in rats and cyno, PTG-200 was GI-restricted with less than 0.5% oral systemic bioavailability
in plasma or urine and principal exposure in the small intestine, colon, and feces. Similar results were observed in cyno. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have also
completed pre-clinical POC studies in rat 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis models demonstrating that oral delivery of PTG-200 and other prototype antagonists significantly improved disease outcomes, such as reducing body weight
loss, reducing the increased colon weight/length ratio, and reducing the increased colon macroscopic score which is comprised of assessments of colon adhesions, strictures, ulcers, and wall thickness in a dose dependent manner (Figure 4).
Furthermore, PTG-200 was found to reduce the increased histopathology summary score, which is comprised of assessments of mucosal and transmural inflammation, gland loss, and erosion parameters. Finally, PTG-200 was able to reduce the expression of
the&nbsp;pro-inflammatory IL-23 induced cytokines in the colon and the IBD&nbsp;disease biomarker lipocalin&nbsp;(LCN2)&nbsp;in the serum and feces&nbsp;(Figure 4). </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PTG-300 was discovered through our peptide technology platform and is being developed as a novel mimetic of hepcidin to potentially treat iron
overload disorders such as <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#098;</FONT>-Thalassemia, HH and SCD, each of which may qualify for orphan designation. Hepcidin is a naturally-occurring hormone involved in the transport and utilization of iron in the
human body. Hepcidin has significant stability, potency, and solubility limitations. In order to effectively treat iron overload disorders in the body, we designed PTG-300 as a stable, soluble, hepcidin mimetic that can potentially be more potent
and more amenable for weekly or less frequent subcutaneous delivery compared to hepcidin. We believe PTG-300 has the potential to improve disease symptoms and provide better safety by reducing the need for blood transfusions and chelator use in <FONT
STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#098;</FONT><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">-Thalassemia</FONT> patients by treating both the underlying anemia and iron overload associated with the disease. We have achieved POC in pre-clinical studies and have

Action </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The molecular target of hepcidin is the cellular trans-membrane protein ferroportin, which functions as an export channel for
intracellular iron in macrophages, liver hepatocytes, and duodenal enterocytes. Upon binding to the extracellular domain of ferroportin, hepcidin decreases the delivery of iron to the blood circulation needed for the production of red blood cells.

studies, which will enable us to complete a single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers in 2017. This study will evaluate safety/ tolerability, PK and PD-based POC through the evaluation of PTG-300&#146;s effect on

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our proprietary technology platform has been successfully applied to a diverse set of biological targets that has led to several pre-clinical
and clinical-stage peptide-based NCEs, including our only clinical-stage product candidate PTG-100, and our other product candidates in pre-clinical studies PTG-200 and PTG-300, for a variety of clinical indications. Our platform is comprised of a
series of tools and methods, including a combination of molecular design, phage display, oral stability, medicinal chemistry, and <I>in vivo</I> pharmacology approaches. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The platform is used to develop potential drug candidates: (i)&nbsp;using the structure of a target, when available, (ii)&nbsp;when no target
structure exists, or (iii)&nbsp;from publically disclosed peptide starting points. In a structure-based approach, our proprietary molecular design software and structural database of several thousand constrained peptides, termed Vectrix<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">TM</SUP>, are screened to identify suitable scaffolds which form the basis of designing and constructing the first set of phage or chemical libraries. The initial hits are identified by either panning or
screening such libraries, respectively. When structural information is unavailable for a target, hits are identified by panning a set of 34 proprietary cluster-based phage libraries consisting of millions of constrained peptides. Once the hits are
identified, they are optimized using a set of peptide, peptide mimetic and medicinal chemistry techniques that include the incorporation of new or manipulation of existing cyclization-constraints, as well as natural or unnatural amino acids and
chemical conjugation or acylation techniques. These techniques are applied to optimize potency, selectivity, stability, exposure and ultimately efficacy. For oral stability, a series of <I>in vitro </I>and <I>ex vivo</I> oral-stability assays that
portray the chemical and metabolic barriers a peptide will encounter as it transits the GI tract are used to identify metabolically labile spots in the peptides. Such sites form the focus of medicinal-chemistry based optimization to engineer oral
stability.&nbsp;Finally, various <I>in vivo</I> pharmacology tools are then used to quantify peptide exposure in relevant GI organs and tissues. The data can then be used to optimize required GI exposure and ultimately <I>in vivo</I> efficacy. </P>

structures of potential new drug targets, including PPI targets. In particular, constrained peptides have the required surface complexity to match or complement the large flat surfaces of PPI targets to provide potent and selective drug candidates.
We believe existing commercial molecular design software is not suitable, as it has been developed to identify small molecules that plug cavities of enzymes and do not bind to PPI targets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have developed a database of all known structures of a sub-class of constrained peptides, known as disulfide-rich peptides
(&#147;DRPs&#148;). We have collected approximately 4,500 DRP scaffolds that are found throughout nature, ranging from single cell organisms to humans. We have created a proprietary molecular design environment, called Vectrix<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">TM</SUP>. A pattern matching algorithm within Vectrix<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">TM</SUP> allows the selection of an appropriately stable DRP scaffold using the structure of the target of
interest. This molecular design process is used to identify constrained peptides as starting points for hit discovery, which are ultimately optimized into potent, selective peptides against targets which are not amenable to small molecule drug
discovery. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Phage display techniques and cluster libraries </I></P>

numerous <I>in vitro</I> and <I>ex vivo</I> systems that profile peptide candidates for their stability features needed for oral delivery, GI restriction, and transit through the entire GI tract. This includes profiling for chemical stability,
specifically pH and redox stability, and metabolic stability against proteases and other enzymes that are either of human or microbial origin. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These <I>in vitro</I> assays identify metabolic weak spots of peptides, which can then be stabilized by peptidic and peptidomimetic

peptide-cyclization, natural and unnatural amino acids, and various conjugation and acylation techniques. With respect to PTG-300, hit discovery and optimization relies exclusively on medicinal chemistry, with no phage display, to develop potent and
selective injectable candidates with enhanced exposure in blood. For other targets, such as the discovery of PTG-100 and PTG-200, phage display is tightly coupled to medicinal chemistry and oral stability techniques to develop potent, selective and
oral molecules that are GI-restricted. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>In vivo pharmacology tools for GI restriction </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When developing oral, GI-restricted constrained peptides, we correlate efficacy with potency and level of GI tissue compartment exposure. We
have developed the required expertise and know-how to build PK and PD relationships to optimize physicochemical features of constrained peptides such that they are minimally absorbed and have the required degree of GI tissue compartment exposure
over the required duration of time to achieve efficacy. This involves examining constrained peptide concentrations in various GI tissue compartments, blood, urine, and feces when delivered orally in rodents. In this fashion, we can understand the
degree of tissue targeting, GI restriction and oral stability that is required to achieve efficacy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Future Applications of our Platform </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe we have built a versatile, well-validated and unique discovery platform. For example, this peptide technology platform has been used
to develop product candidates for diverse target classes including G-protein-coupled receptors (&#147;GPCRs&#148;), ion channels, transporters and cytokines for a variety of therapeutic areas. In the future we may tackle other GI diseases and expand
our delivery techniques to include other organ/tissue systems, such as the lung and eye, which will provide potential opportunities to pursue a variety of diseases. In addition, the gut may communicate with the immune, central nervous, and endocrine
systems, providing the potential of our GI-restricted approach to treat metabolic, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Lastly, we intend to progress our platform to achieve systemic bioavailability with peptides, thereby enabling us to address
systemic diseases. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in
which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent&#146;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of
a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is
related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug
may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions
to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application (&#147;NDA&#148;), we expect to apply for patent term
extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Trade Secrets </I></P>

the use of contract manufacturing organization (&#147;CMOs&#148;) eliminates the need for us to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel and consultants
have extensive manufacturing experience overseeing CMOs. We regularly consider second source or back-up manufacturers for both active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the
manufacturing requirements for the product candidates in a timely manner. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands but we have
not assessed these capabilities beyond the supply of clinical materials to date. We currently engage CMOs on a &#147;fee for services&#148; basis based on our current development plans. We plan to identify CMOs and enter into longer term contracts
or commitments as we move our product candidates into Phase 3 clinical trials. We believe there are alternate sources of manufacturing that have been and could be engaged and enabled to satisfy its clinical and commercial requirements, however we

to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a
clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or EC can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the
clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. </P>

completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are
submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act
(&#147;PDUFA&#148;) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of &#147;filing&#148; of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve
months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a &#147;filing&#148; decision. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (&#147;PREA&#148;), as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed
indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant
deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (&#147;REMS&#148;), plan to ensure that the benefits of the
drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization
tools. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to
determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The
resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the
drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#146;s continued safety, quality and purity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including
clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it
considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or
facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the
product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. </P>

recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a
statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional
information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An
approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if the
FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials,
be conducted to further assess a drug&#146;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk
management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance
programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. </P>

orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable
expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.&nbsp;Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a NDA or Biologics License
Application (&#147;BLA&#148;). After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration
of the regulatory review and approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as
opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan
exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven&nbsp;years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product
with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for
which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven
years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#146;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological
product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. </P>

manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may impose a number of
post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#146;s safety and effectiveness
after commercialization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved
drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process
are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the
sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or
if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with
regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions

among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor.&nbsp;The coverage determination process can be a time-consuming and costly process that may require
us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently. Even if reimbursement is provided, market
acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for health care providers or less profitable than alternative treatments, or if administrative burdens make our products less
desirable to use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing
cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products.&nbsp;Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in
jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could

to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on certain companies that manufacture or import branded
prescription drug products. The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and expanded the rebate program to include Medicaid managed care organizations. It also contains substantial new provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance,
reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against health care fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the health care industry, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose
additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA
in the future.&nbsp;The ACA is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted
in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action
is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers
from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is uncertain
whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions foreign, federal, state, or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any such

authorities in the United States and other countries, each of which has differing regulations. In addition, even if approved, our pricing and reimbursement will be subject to further review and discussions with payors. We are not permitted to market
any product candidate in the United States until after approval of a new drug application (&#147;NDA&#148;) from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until after approval of a marketing application by corresponding regulatory authorities. We
completed a Phase 1 clinical trial for PTG-100 in June 2016. We will need to conduct larger, more extensive clinical trials in the target patient population to support a potential application for regulatory approval by the FDA or corresponding
regulatory authorities, and we do not expect to be in a position to do so for the near term. We will not receive any preferential or expedited review of any application for regulatory approval by virtue of the fact that our product candidates target
biological pathways that are also targeted by currently marketed injectable antibody drugs, and our product candidates will be subject to the regulatory review processes applicable to completely new drugs. </P>

trials to demonstrate substantial evidence of efficacy and safety for each product candidate we intend to commercialize. Further, given the patient populations for which we are developing therapeutics, we expect to have to evaluate long-term
exposure to establish the safety of our therapeutics in a chronic dose setting. We have never conducted a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial or submitted an NDA, and as a result, we have no history or track-record to rely on when entering these
phases of the development cycle. For example, the results generated to date in pre-clinical studies and the Phase 1 clinical trial for PTG-100 do not ensure that future Phase 2 clinical trials or later clinical trials will have similar results or be
successful. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. Clinical trial failures may result from a
multitude of factors including, but not limited to, flaws in trial design, dose selection, placebo effect, patient enrollment criteria and failure to demonstrate favorable safety and/or efficacy traits of the product candidate. A number of companies

safety and efficacy data with respect to the study drug, the number and nature of competing treatments and ongoing clinical trials of competing drugs for the same indication, the proximity of patients to clinical trial sites and the eligibility
criteria for the clinical trial. Furthermore, any negative results we may report in clinical trials of our product candidates may make it difficult or impossible to recruit and retain patients in other clinical trials of that same candidate. For
example, we are aware of a number of therapies that are commercialized or are being developed for IBD and we expect to face competition from these investigational drugs or approved drugs for potential subjects in our clinical trials, which may delay
the pace of enrollment in our planned clinical trials. Delays or failures in planned patient enrollment or retention may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop our product

contract manufactures to manufacture and provide product for us that meet these requirements. We do not currently have nor do we plan to acquire the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our pre-clinical and clinical drug supplies
and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our peptide-based product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We expect to continue to depend on contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. In particular, as we
proceed with the development and potential commercialization of PTG-100, we will need to increase the scale at which the drug is manufactured, which will require the development of new manufacturing processes. We will rely on our contract
manufacturer to develop the manufacturing processes required for larger scale production. If the contract manufacturer is not successful in developing large scale processes, our development and/or commercialization of PTG-100 could be materially
delayed. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Moreover, our contract manufacturers are the sole source of supply for our
clinical product candidates, including PTG-100. If we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply for any reason, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions
or termination of our clinical study and planned development program, or be required to restart or repeat, any ongoing clinical trials. </P>

materials necessary to produce our peptide-based product candidates for our clinical trials, and if approved, for commercial sale. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers.
Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a peptide-based product candidate to
complete the clinical trial, any significant delay in the supply of a peptide-based product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a contract manufacturer or other third party
manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our peptide-based product candidates. If our contract manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after
regulatory approval has been obtained for our peptide-based product candidates, the commercial launch of our peptide-based product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenue

conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory
authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our peptide-based product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our strategy includes filing for orphan drug designation where available for our product candidates. Under the Orphan Drug Act,
the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as one occurring in a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than
200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or biologic will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial
incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which
it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years,
except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have not obtained nor have we sought to obtain orphan designation for any product candidates to date, although we believe some of the
potential indications of our product candidates could qualify for orphan drug designation and the related benefits if approved for that indication. For example, if PTG-100 or PTG-200 is developed for the treatment of pediatric IBD or PTG-300 for the
treatment of iron overload disorders in patients with &szlig;-Thalassemia and possibly HH and SCD, we plan to file and expect to qualify for orphan drug designation with respect to such indication. Even if we obtain such designations, we may not be
the first to obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be
limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantities of
the product to meet the needs of patients with the orphan-designated disease or condition. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug designation exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition
because different drugs with different active moieties may receive and be approved for the same condition, and only the first applicant to receive approval will receive the benefits of marketing exclusivity. Even after an orphan-designated product
is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a later drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior if it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to
patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, while we may seek orphan drug designation
for our product candidates, we may never receive such designations. </P>

obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative
arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of newer technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors
may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing, on an exclusive basis, pharmaceutical products that are easier to develop, more effective or less costly than any product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop. If

commercially successful. If our competitors succeed in obtaining FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval or discovering, developing and commercializing drugs before we do or develop blocking intellectual property to which we do not have a license,

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included
aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional action is
taken by Congress. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period in which the
government may recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their commercial products. The implementation
of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates, if approved. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts
that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare therapies, which could result in reduced demand for our peptide-based product candidates or additional pricing pressures. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional
challenges. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act.
Further, on January&nbsp;20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any
provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.
Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the Affordable Care Act that are repealed. Thus, the full impact of the Affordable Care Act, or any law replacing elements of it, on our business remains unclear. The
implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. </P>

for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our
product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA&#146;s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and
post-marketing testing and other requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Governments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely

and pricing negotiations may continue after coverage and reimbursement have been obtained. Reference pricing used by various countries and parallel distribution or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced countries, can further reduce prices. To
obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies, which is time-consuming and costly. If coverage

V. Patel, Ph.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Y. Liu, Ph.D., our Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development, Richard S. Shames, M.D., our Chief Medical Officer, Tom O&#146;Neil, our Chief Financial Officer and
William Hodder, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. We are not aware of any present intention of any of these individuals to leave us. In order to induce valuable employees to continue their employment with us, we have provided stock
options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time is significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to maintain retention incentives or
counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. All of our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time, with or without notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees and our
inability to find suitable replacements would harm our research and development efforts as well as our business, financial condition and prospects. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled
and experienced personnel with scientific, medical, regulatory, manufacturing and management training and skills. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may not be able to
attract or retain qualified personnel in the future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Many of the other biopharmaceutical and
pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. Our competitors may provide higher compensation or more
diverse opportunities and better opportunities for career advancement. Any or all of these competing factors may limit our ability to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, which could negatively affect our ability to successfully
develop and commercialize peptide-based product candidates and to grow our business and operations as currently contemplated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We will need to

Internet-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. The size and complexity of our internal computer systems and those of our CROs, contract manufacturers and other third parties on which we rely
may make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, telecommunications and electrical failures, malicious intrusion and computer viruses that may result in the impairment of key business processes. In addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable
to data security breaches&#151;whether by employees or others&#151;that may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the
public exposure of personally identifiable information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, collaborators, clinical trial patients, and others. A data security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or
modification of or prevents access to patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws, subject us
to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. If we are unable
to prevent such data security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or
misappropriated information, including sensitive patient data. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover,
the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have implemented
security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. Any such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on the development of our product

candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party
payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to

significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp;
Medicaid Services (&#147;CMS&#148;), an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow CMS to
a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel products such as ours since there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Reimbursement agencies in
Europe may be more conservative than CMS. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive
governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries may cause us to price our tablet vaccine candidates on less favorable terms than
we currently anticipate. In many countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In these countries, pricing negotiations
with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the
cost-effectiveness of our peptide-based product candidates to other available therapies. In general, the prices of products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices
for products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our peptide-based product candidates. Accordingly, in markets
outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and internationally, to cap or reduce healthcare
costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in
connection with the sale of any of our tablet vaccine candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs
in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products into the healthcare market. </P>

time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in
issued patents in the United States or in other foreign countries, or they may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or technologies in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance
that all the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patent and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents have been issued, or do
successfully issue, from our patent applications, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are
unchallenged, our patent and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates and technologies, or prevent others from designing around our claims. </P>

patents owned by or, if applicable in the future, licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates and technologies that we may
develop. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials or in gaining regulatory approval, the period of time during which we could market any of our product candidates under patent protection, if approved, would be reduced. Since patent
applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates and
technologies. Furthermore, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&#147;PTO&#148;) to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent
claims of our applications. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available however the life of a patent, and the
protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications. </P>

provided. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. Moreover, if we do obtain necessary licenses, we will likely have obligations under those

United States. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and
abroad. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. We cannot guarantee that our employees, former employees or
consultants will not file patent applications claiming our inventions. Because of the &#147;first-to-file&#148; laws in the United States, such unauthorized patent application filings may defeat our attempts to obtain patents on our own inventions.

independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of

a third party to enforce a patent covering our product candidates or technologies, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or
unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory
requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the PTO, or made a
misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, inter partes review,
post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, such as opposition or derivation proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover and protect our
product candidates or technologies. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity of our patents, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of
which we, our patent counsel, and the patent examiner were unaware of during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent

manufacture, market and sell our drug candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing or otherwise violating the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and
other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, derivation proceedings, post grant reviews, inter partes reviews, and reexamination proceedings before the
PTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product
candidates, and there may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates and technologies. Third
parties, including our competitors may initiate legal proceedings against us alleging that we are infringing or otherwise violating their patent or other intellectual property rights. Given the vast number of patents in our field of technology, we
cannot assure you that marketing of our product candidates or practice of our technologies will not infringe existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be
confidential for 18 months or more after filing, and because pending patent claims can be revised before issuance, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that may be infringed by the
practice of our peptide therapeutics technology platform or the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates. If a patent holder believes our product candidates or technologies infringe on its patent, the patent

candidates or technologies infringe upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing
process or any final product or formulation itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. As
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates or technologies may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further
practice our technologies or develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources
from our business. Even if we are successful in defending against any infringement claims, litigation is expensive and time-consuming and is likely to divert management&#146;s attention and substantial resources from our core business, which could
harm our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees for willful infringement (which may include situations in which we had
knowledge of an issued patent but nonetheless proceeded with activity which infringed such patent), limit our uses, pay royalties or redesign our infringing product candidates, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary
expenditure. We may choose to seek, or may be required to seek, a license from the third-party patent holder and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both, each of which could be substantial. These licenses may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms, however, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights we obtain may be nonexclusive, which would provide our competitors access to the same intellectual property rights upon which we are
forced to rely. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to
obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In such an event, we would be unable to further practice our technologies or develop and commercialize any of our product candidates at issue, which could harm our
business significantly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not identify relevant third party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third

sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial
resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating or from successfully challenging our intellectual

intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States may be less extensive than those in the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain
foreign jurisdictions. The requirements for patentability differ, in varying degrees, from country to country. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patent and other intellectual
property rights, especially those relating to life sciences. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, to the same extent as federal and state laws of the United States.
This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of any patents we obtain or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including
government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Moreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign
intellectual property laws. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, regardless of whether successful, would

to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate, which may have an adverse

similar provisions during the patent application process. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the PTO and various governmental patent
agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals and rely on such third parties to help us comply with these requirements and effect
payment of these fees with respect to the patent and patent applications that we own, and if we in-license intellectual property we may have to rely upon our licensors to comply with these requirements and effect payment of these fees with respect
to any patents and patent applications that we license. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can
result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would

Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Leahy-Smith Act) was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and
may also affect patent litigation. The PTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular,
the first to file provisions, did not become effective until March 2013, 18 months after its enactment. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act
and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and

agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our
trademarks may not survive such proceedings. Moreover, any name we propose to use with our product candidates in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark.
The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant
additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. </P>

resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, we and our independent registered public accounting firm
identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first
material weakness related to a deficiency in the operation of our internal controls over the accounting for non-routine, complex equity transactions, which resulted in material post-closing adjustments to the convertible preferred stock, additional
paid-in capital, interest expense, and gain from modification of the redeemable convertible preferred stock balances in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. Our lack of adequate accounting personnel has
resulted in the identification of a second material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. Specifically, we did not, and have not historically, appropriately designed and
implemented controls over the review and approval of manual journal entries and the related supporting journal entry calculations. </P>

and implemented an approval process related to manual journal entries and the related supporting journal entry calculations. In addition, we are continuing to work on designing and implementing additional improved processes and internal controls.
While we intend to implement a plan to remediate the material weaknesses, we have not completed the implementation of this plan as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. Accordingly, we continue to have the material weaknesses as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. We
can give no assurance that our current and planned implementation will remediate this deficiency in internal control or that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting will not be
identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements and cause us to
fail to meet our reporting obligations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting

reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until our first Annual Report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we
are no longer an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#147;JOBS Act&#148;). At such time as we are required to obtain auditor attestation, if we then have a material weakness, we

internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by

requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel will need to
devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements, and we will likely need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company reporting experience and technical accounting

be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public

Selected Financial Data&#148; and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and

clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary technology platform focused on discovering and developing peptide-based new chemical entities (&#147;NCEs&#148;) to address significant unmet medical needs. Our primary focus is on
developing first-in-class peptide drugs that specifically target biological pathways also targeted by currently marketed injectable antibody drugs. Compared to injectable antibody drugs, our oral peptides offer targeted delivery to the
gastrointestinal (&#147;GI&#148;) tissue compartment, potential for improved safety due to minimal exposure in the blood, and improved convenience and compliance due to oral delivery. Our initial lead product candidates, PTG-100 and PTG-200, are
based on this approach, and we believe have the potential to transform the existing treatment paradigm for inflammatory bowel disease (&#147;IBD&#148;), a GI disease consisting primarily of ulcerative colitis (&#147;UC&#148;) and Crohn&#146;s
disease (&#147;CD&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PTG-100 is a potential first-in-class oral, alpha-4-beta-7
(&#147;<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>4<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#098;</FONT>7&#148;) integrin-specific antagonist peptide product candidate which is currently being evaluated in a global Phase 2b study that is anticipated to
enroll approximately 260 patients at about 100 clinical sites. We anticipate completing this trial in the second half of 2018. Our second lead product candidate, PTG-200, is a potential first-in-class oral Interleukin-23 receptor <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(&#147;IL-23R&#148;)</FONT> antagonist being developed initially for moderate-to-severe CD. Interleukin-23 is a protein produced by white blood cells that regulates inflammatory and immune functions. PTG-200 is currently
in Investigational New Drug (&#147;IND&#148;) enabling studies, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our novel
peptides have potential applicability in a wide range of therapeutic areas in addition to GI diseases. Our first product candidate beyond IBD is PTG-300, an injectable hepcidin mimetic, which is currently in pre-clinical development. We plan to
complete pre-clinical IND-enabling studies in PTG-300 in the first half of 2017 and complete a Phase 1 study in healthy normal volunteers by the end of 2017. PTG-300 has potential utility for the treatment of iron overload disorders, such as
transfusion-dependent &szlig;-Thalassemia, hereditary hemochromatosis (&#147;HH&#148;) and sickle cell disease (&#147;SCD&#148;), each of which may qualify for orphan designation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are currently researching additional potential oral and injectable peptide-based product candidates for a range of conditions including,
but not restricted to GI diseases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have not generated any revenue from product sales, and we do not currently have any products
approved for commercialization. We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $37.2 million, $14.9 million and $11.1 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $64.6 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and
administrative costs associated with our operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2016, we completed our initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) of our
common stock pursuant to which we issued 7,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $12.00 per share. In September 2016, we issued an additional of 252,972 shares of common stock at a price of $12.00 per share following the
underwriters&#146; exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. We received an aggregate of $83.6 million in cash from the IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and after deducting offering costs paid by us. </P>

costs are incurred. In addition, we recognize the funds related to our Australian research and development tax incentives that are not subject to refund provisions as a reduction of research and development expense. The amounts are determined on a
cost reimbursement basis and as the incentive is related to our research and development expenditures and is non-refundable regardless of whether any Australian tax is owed, the amounts have been recorded as a reduction of research and development
expenses. These Australian research and development tax incentives are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received, the relevant expenditure has been incurred and the amount of the consideration can be reliably
measured. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Australian overseas finding research and development tax incentives are no longer deemed to be at risk of clawback as less than 50% of our research and development expenditures under the program were
incurred overseas. As a result we have recognized the amounts received for 2014 and 2015 and the amount expected to be received for 2016 qualified expenditures as a reduction of research and development expense during the year ended

statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are
based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as
these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management&#146;s judgments and estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Accrued Research and Development Costs

providers, which include the conduct of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities. We record the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not
yet invoiced, and include these costs in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations. These costs are a significant component of our research and
development expenses. We record accrued expenses for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with these third-party service providers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or
stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued
estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may
vary from our estimates and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrued expenses are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from clinical research
organizations and other third-party service providers. To date, there have been no material differences from our accrued expenses to actual expenses. </P>

determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term). We have very limited historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and

2016, we were privately held and did not have any trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the
expected term of the stock option grants.&nbsp;The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle, or area of specialty. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical

Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the Black-Scholes assumptions, we estimate our forfeiture rate
based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior, and other factors. The impact from any forfeiture rate
adjustment would be recognized in full in the period of adjustment and if the actual number of future forfeitures differs from our estimates, we might be required to record adjustments to stock-based compensation in future periods. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, stock-based compensation expense was $2.1&nbsp;million, $99,000 and $42,000,
respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had $12.6&nbsp;million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation costs, net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 3.12 years. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, for all periods prior to our IPO in August 2016, the fair values of the shares of common stock underlying our share-based awards
were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of our common stock
prepared by an unrelated third-party valuation firm in accordance with the guidance provide by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, <I>Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as
Compensation</I>. Given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of
our common stock, including our stage of development; progress of our research and development efforts; the rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; equity market conditions affecting
comparable public companies and the lack of marketability of our common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For stock options granted after the completion of the IPO,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We assess the likelihood
that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, our total gross deferred tax assets were $24.0 million. Due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties
surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards.&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $48.0 million which are available to offset future taxable income, if any, through 2033 and net operating loss carryforwards
for state income tax purposes of approximately $37.7 million which are available to offset future taxable income, if any, through 2033.&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2016,&nbsp;we also had accumulated Australian tax losses of $9.2 million available
for carry forward against future earnings, which under relevant tax laws do not expire but may not be available under certain circumstances. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership changes that may have
occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code), and similar state provisions. These ownership change limitations may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and
other tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an &#147;ownership change&#148; as defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code results from a transaction or series of transactions
over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points (by value) of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders. Since our formation, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock
on several occasions, which separately or combined with the purchasing stockholders&#146; subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in such ownership changes, or could result in ownership changes in the future. </P>

$25.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $6.5 million related to contract manufacturing activities for PTG-100 clinical trials and other product candidate studies, an increase of
$2.8 million in costs for third party consultants, an increase of $2.7 million in pre-clinical activities for our product candidates, an increase of $2.6 million in salaries and employee-related expense due to an increase in headcount, an increase
of $1.9 million in PTG-100 Phase 1 clinical trials and other related studies, an increase of $0.3 million due to achieving certain development milestones in a prior collaboration agreement related to the initiation of preclinical development studies
on PTG-300 and an increase of $0.3 million in facility expenses. The increases were partially offset by an increase of $3.3 million in government programs recognized as a reduction of research and development expenses, primarily due to the increase
in our Australian research and development tax incentive including the recognition of amounts related to overseas finding that are no longer deemed to be at risk of clawback and funds earned under the Small Business Research grant awards. </P>

2015, to $7.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.9 million in professional service fees, an increase of $1.8 million increase in salaries and employee-related expense due to an
increase in headcount to support the growth of our operations and an increase of $0.3 million in facility and other administrative expenses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Change

fair value remeasurement of the outstanding mark to market liabilities as the fair value increased in 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Comparison of the years ended

to relocate our operations to a larger facility. The lease commencement date is July&nbsp;1, 2017 and the lease expires on June&nbsp;30, 2024. The aggregate minimum lease payments under the lease agreement will be approximately $13.4 million, and we
are providing the landlord with a security deposit of $450,000. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with contract
research organizations for clinical trials and with vendors for pre-clinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes, which are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 to 60 days prior written notice. These payments
are not included in this table of contractual obligations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the amounts set forth in the table above, we have certain
obligations under licensing agreements with third parties contingent upon achieving various development, regulatory and commercial milestones. In October 2013, the collaboration program under our Research Collaboration and License Agreement with
Zealand Pharma A/S (Zealand) was abandoned by Zealand. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we elected to assume the responsibility for the development and commercialization of the product candidate. Upon Zealand&#146;s abandonment, Zealand
assigned to us certain intellectual property arising from the collaboration and also granted us an exclusive license to certain background intellectual property rights of Zealand that relate to the products assumed by us. Upon the nomination of
PTG-300 as a development candidate, we owed Zealand a payment of $250,000, which has been recognized within research and development expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. If we initiate a
Phase 1 clinical trial for PTG-300, we will pay Zealand an additional $250,000. We have the right, but not the obligation, to further develop and commercialize the product candidate and, if we successfully develop and commercialize PTG-300 without a
partner, we will pay to Zealand up to an additional aggregate of $128.5 million for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events. In addition, we will pay to Zealand a low single digit royalty on worldwide net sales
of the product. As the achievement and timing of these future milestone payments are not probable and estimable, such amounts have not been included on our consolidated balance sheets or in the contractual obligations table above. </P>

ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are
issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.&nbsp;Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to
continue as a going concern.&nbsp;ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.&nbsp;We adopted this standard effective
December&nbsp;31, 2016, and there was no impact related to the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2015,
the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-17, <I>Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes</I>, which is intended to simplify and improve how deferred taxes are classified on the balance sheet. The guidance in this ASU
eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet and now requires entities to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.&nbsp;The guidance
is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and for interim periods within those annual periods though early adoption is permitted. We do not expect that the adoption of the guidance will have a material effect on our
consolidated financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-02, <I>Leases </I>(Topic 842). Under the new
guidance, (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged, while lessees will no longer be provided with a
source of off-balance sheet financing. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (January 1, 2019, for us). Early
application is permitted. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial
statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. While we are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our
consolidated financial statements, we expect our non-cancellable operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, but we do not
expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material impact on our results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No.&nbsp;2016-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income
tax consequences, the determination of forfeiture rates, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.&nbsp;This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years
beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted.&nbsp;We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. </P>

provide financial statement users with more useful information about expected credit losses on financial assets held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The new standard replaces the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a
methodology that requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable forward-looking information to estimate all expected credit losses. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning
after December&nbsp;15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. </P>

maturities greater than 365 days as of the balance sheet date. Such interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk; however, historical fluctuations in interest income have not been material. We had no outstanding debt as of

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2016, the Company&#146;s board of directors approved an amendment to the Company&#146;s amended and restated certificate of
incorporation to effect a reverse split of the Company&#146;s issued and outstanding common stock at a 1-for-14.5 ratio, which was effected on August&nbsp;1, 2016. The par value and authorized shares of common stock and convertible preferred stock

outstanding shares of the redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into 8,577,571 shares of common stock and there are no shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding. In September 2016, the Company issued an additional

include these costs in accrued expenses and other payables in the consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations. These costs are a significant component of the Company&#146;s
research and development expenses. The Company accrues for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with its third-party service providers. The Company makes significant
judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accrued liabilities. The Company has not experienced any material differences between accrued
costs and actual costs incurred. However, the status and timing of actual services performed, number of patients enrolled, and the rate of patient enrollments may vary from the Company&#146;s estimates, resulting in adjustments to expense in future
periods. Changes in these estimates that result in material changes to the Company&#146;s accruals could materially affect the Company&#146;s results of operations. </P>

Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,
and tax loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
realized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.

AUD 20.0&nbsp;million and cannot be controlled by income tax exempt entities.&nbsp;These research and development tax incentives are recognized as contra research and development expense when the right to receive has been attained and funds are
considered to be collectible. The tax incentive is denominated in Australian dollars and, therefore, the related receivable is remeasured into U.S. dollars as of each reporting date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under certain conditions, research and development activities conducted outside Australia (&#147;overseas finding&#148;) also qualify for the
research and development tax incentive. Funds received for overseas finding are at a risk of clawback until substantiation that less than 50% research and development expenditures for a project will be incurred overseas. A deferred tax incentive is
recorded upon the cash receipt of the overseas finding funds and a reduction of research and development expenses is not recognized until the Company can substantiate that more than 50% of the total project expenditure will occur in Australia. </P>

years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. The accounting guidance for fair value provides a framework for measuring fair
value, clarifies the definition of fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Level 1</I>&#151;Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Level 2&#151;</I>Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or
liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument&#146;s anticipated life. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Level 3</I>&#151;Inputs reflect management&#146;s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at
the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In determining fair value, the Company utilizes quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotation, or valuation techniques that maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following table presents the fair value of the Company&#146;s financial assets and liabilities determined using the inputs defined above

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The corporate bonds, commercial paper and government bonds are classified as Level 2 as they were valued based
upon quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market
or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 3 instruments are valued based on
unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the Company&#146;s assumptions in measuring fair value. The fair value measurements of the redeemable convertible preferred stock tranche liability and the redeemable
convertible preferred stock warrant liability were based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The redeemable convertible preferred stock tranche liability stems from the initial sale of the Company&#146;s Series C redeemable convertible
preferred stock wherein the Company was obligated to sell additional shares in subsequent closings contingent upon a majority of the stockholders of the outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock and/or the achievement of certain development
milestones. The subsequent closings were deemed to be freestanding financial instruments that were at the option of the holders. The Company estimated the fair value of this liability using a one-step binomial lattice model in combination with the
Option Pricing Model. The change in fair value was recognized as a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 10 for further discussion on the redeemable convertible preferred stock tranche liability and related valuations.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The determination of the fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability is discussed in Note 8. Generally,
increases or decreases in the fair value of the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock would result in a directionally similar impact in the fair value measurement of the warrant liability. </P>

it assigned to the Company certain intellectual property arising from the collaboration and also granted the Company an exclusive license to certain background intellectual property rights of the former collaboration partner that relate to the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognized AUD 5.3&nbsp;million ($4.0 million), AUD 978,000 ($736,000) and AUD 639,000 ($577,000) as a reduction of research and

October 2016, the Company received AUD 3.0&nbsp;million ($2.2 million) including interest, in connection with the Australian research and development tax incentive. Of the funds received, AUD 1.0&nbsp;million ($0.7 million) reduced the research and
development tax incentive receivable and AUD 2.0&nbsp;million ($1.5 million), which was for overseas findings, was recorded as deferred tax incentive in accrued expenses and other payables on the consolidated balance sheet due to the risk of

incentive program was complete and the Company substantiated that more than 50% of the total project expenditures occurred in Australia. Therefore, the overseas finding related incentive amounts are not deemed to be at risk of clawback and the

Interleukin-23 receptor (&#147;IL-23R&#148;) as potential treatments for inflammatory bowel diseases (&#147;IBD&#148;). The total grant award was $224,000 and is for the period from September 2015 to August 2016. </P>

indemnification will continue after the termination of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these provisions is not determinable. The Company has also entered into indemnification
agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers to the fullest extent permitted by
California corporate law. The Company currently has directors&#146; and officers&#146; insurance. To date, the Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to the indemnification agreements. The Company

the Company established its 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the &#147;2007 Plan&#148;) which provides for the granting of stock options to employees and consultants of the Company. Options granted under the 2007 Plan may be either incentive
stock options (ISOs) or nonqualified stock options (NSOs). ISOs may be granted only to Company employees (including officers and directors who are also employees). NSOs may be granted to Company employees and consultants. Options under the 2007 Plan
have a term of ten years and generally vest over a four-year period with one-year cliff vesting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2016, the Company&#146;s board
of directors and stockholders approved the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;2016 Plan&#148;) to replace the 2007 Stock Option Plan and became effective upon the IPO. The 2016 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors or a committee
appointed by the Board of Directors, which determines the types of awards to be granted, including the number of shares subject to the awards, the exercise price and the vesting schedule. Under the 2016 Plan, 1,200,000 shares of the Company&#146;s
common stock have been initially reserved for the issuance of stock options, restricted stock units and other awards to employees, directors and consultants. Options granted under the 2016 Plan expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.
The exercise price of each option may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. Options may be granted to stockholders possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stocks of the Company at an exercise price at least 110% of the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant and the options are not exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date of grant. Employee stock options generally vest
25% upon one year of continued service to the Company, with the remainder in monthly increments over three additional years. Upon adoption of the 2016 Plan, no additional stock awards will be issued under the 2007 Stock Option Plan. Options granted
under the 2007 Stock Option Plan that were outstanding on the date the 2016 plan became effective remain subject to the terms of the 2007 Stock Option Plan. The number of options available for grant under the 2007 Plan was ceased and the number was
added to the common stock reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company has reserved 1,200,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2016 Plan. </P>

there had been no public market for the Company&#146;s common stock prior to August 2016, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors had determined fair value of the common stock at the time of grant
of the option by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including important developments in the Company&#146;s operations, valuations performed by an independent third party, sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock, actual
operating results and financial performance, the conditions in the biotechnology industry and the economy in general, the stock price performance and volatility of comparable public companies, and the lack of liquidity of the Company&#146;s common
stock, among other factors. For stock options granted after the completion of the IPO, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors determined the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of the Company&#146;s common
stock as reported on the date of grant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In determining the fair value of the options granted, the Company uses the Black-Scholes

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Expected Term</I>&#151;The Company&#146;s expected term represents the period that the Company&#146;s options granted are expected to be
outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term). The Company has very limited historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future
exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for its stock option grants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Expected Volatility</I>&#151;Since the
Company does not have a long trading history for its common stock, the expected volatility is estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock
option grants. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance because of the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial
reporting as described below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Exemption from management&#146;s report on internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2016 </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include a report of management&#146;s assessment regarding internal
control over financial reporting on an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly public companies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Material Weaknesses </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with
the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first material weakness related to a deficiency in the operation of our internal controls
over the accounting for non-routine, complex equity transactions, which resulted in material post-closing adjustments to the convertible preferred stock, additional paid-in capital, interest expense, and gain from modification of the redeemable
convertible preferred stock balances in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. Our lack of adequate accounting personnel has resulted in the identification of a second material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. Specifically, we did not, and have not historically, appropriately design and implement controls over the review and approval of manual journal entries and the
related supporting journal entry calculations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Remediation Plans</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we intend to implement a plan to remediate the material weaknesses, we have not completed the implementation of this plan as of
December&nbsp;31, 2016. Accordingly, we continue to have the material weaknesses as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. We can give no assurance that our current and planned implementation will remediate this deficiency in internal control or that additional
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Our plan to remediate the material weaknesses includes implementing a new accounting software system, adding
additional accounting personnel and performing a review of manual journal entries. We identified and began implementation of an accounting system to improve our information systems related controls, which went into production in early 2017. We have
recruited and intend to continue to recruit additional finance and accounting personnel as needed to enhance segregation of duties, we will continue to utilize consultants with technical accounting expertise as needed, and we will establish formal
written policies for our accounting function. </P>
