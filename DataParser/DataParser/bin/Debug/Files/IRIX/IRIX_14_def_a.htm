bylaws and corporate governance guidelines do not require that our chairman and chief executive officer positions be separate and the Board believes that combining the positions is the appropriate leadership structure for the Company at this time.
The CEO is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the Company and the day to day leadership and performance of the Company, while the Chairman of the Board leads the Board in its fundamental role of providing advice to and oversight of

and provide objective oversight of our business and strategy. The Lead Independent Director chairs Board meetings during any sessions conducted as executive sessions without employee directors or other employees being present, and also consults with
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer on business issues. Other responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director include preside at all Board meetings at which the Chairman is not present; provide input to the
Chairman, as is necessary or appropriate, with respect to the agendas for meetings of the Board and its committees; call meetings of independent directors, as necessary; preside at executive sessions of independent directors; communicate feedback
from executive sessions of independent directors to management and/or the Chairman; advise the Chairman with respect to the quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information from Company management to the independent directors as is
necessary or appropriate for the independent directors to effectively and responsibly perform their duties; advise the Chairman on the retention of advisors and consultants who report directly to the Board; be available for consultation and
communication with significant stockholders, as reasonably requested; with the Chairman, coordinate the assessment of Board Committee structure, organization, and charters, and evaluate the need for any changes; coordinate, with the Compensation
Committee, the performance evaluation of the Chairman; receive messages from stockholders wishing to communicate directly with the non-management directors and facilitate an appropriate response; participate in Board candidate interviews, as

2008. In 2014, the stockholders approved an amendment to the 2008&nbsp;EIP for purposes of complying with Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, to increase the share reserve under the 2008&nbsp;EIP, and to make certain other amendments to the terms of
the 2008&nbsp;EIP. The 2008&nbsp;EIP provides for the grant of the following types of incentive awards: (i)&nbsp;stock options; (ii)&nbsp;stock purchase rights; (iii)&nbsp;restricted stock; (iv)&nbsp;restricted stock units; (v)&nbsp;performance
shares; (vi)&nbsp;performance units; and (vii)&nbsp;stock appreciation rights. Since the expiration of the 1998 Stock Plan, equity compensation granted to the Company&#146;s non-employee directors has been granted under the 2008&nbsp;EIP. The
exercise price of incentive stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2008&nbsp;EIP must be at least equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of grant. With respect to any recipient who owns stock possessing more
than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, the exercise price of any option or stock purchase right granted must be at least equal to 110% of the fair market value at the time of grant. Options granted under the 2008&nbsp;EIP are
exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the administrator of the plan; generally over a four-year period. The maximum term of incentive stock options granted to any recipient must not exceed ten years; provided, however,
that the maximum term of an incentive stock option granted to any recipient possessing more than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock must not exceed five years. In the case of stock purchase rights, unless the administrator of
the plan determines otherwise, we have a repurchase option exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser&#146;s employment with us for any reason (including death or disability). Such repurchase option lapses at a rate
determined by the administrator of the plan. The purchase price for shares repurchased by us is the original price paid by the purchaser. The form of consideration for exercising an option or stock purchase right, including the method of payment, is
determined by the administrator. The 2008&nbsp;EIP expires in June 2018. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In the event of a merger or change

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Board is requesting that stockholders approve the Company&#146;s 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;2008&nbsp;EIP&#148;), as amended and restated to provide for an increase in the shares of Common
Stock (&#147;Shares&#148;) reserved for issuance under the 2008&nbsp;EIP by an additional 650,000 Shares (the &#147;Share Increase&#148;) and an extension of the expiration of the 2008&nbsp;EIP by an additional four years to June&nbsp;11, 2022
(&#147;Term Amendment,&#148; and together with the Share Increase, the &#147;Plan Amendments&#148;). Further, we are seeking stockholder approval of the material terms of the 2008&nbsp;EIP, as amended and restated, for purposes of being eligible to
receive a federal income tax deduction for any compensation paid under the 2008&nbsp;EIP that constitutes &#147;performance based compensation&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. If our stockholders approve the amended and
restated 2008&nbsp;EIP, it will replace the current version of the 2008&nbsp;EIP and will continue in effect through June&nbsp;11, 2022, unless earlier terminated by the Board. In April 2017, our Board approved the amended and restated
2008&nbsp;EIP, subject to approval from the stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Board believes that
approval of the amended and restated 2008&nbsp;EIP is essential to the Company&#146;s continued success as the additional Shares will enable the Company to continue to use the amended and restated 2008&nbsp;EIP to achieve its employee performance,
recruiting, retention and incentive goals. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Board and management believe that grants of equity awards to
employees motivate high levels of performance, promote closer alignment of the interests of employees and stockholders by giving employees the perspective of an owner with an equity stake in the Company, and provide an effective means of recognizing
employee contributions to the success of the Company. The Board and management believe that equity awards are a competitive necessity in our high-technology industry, and are essential to recruiting and retaining the highly qualified technical and
other key personnel who help the Company meet its goals, as well as rewarding and encouraging current employees. The Board and management believe that the ability to continue to grant equity awards will be important to the future success of the
Company. If stockholders do not approve the amended and restated 2008&nbsp;EIP, no Shares will be added to the existing, total number of Shares reserved for issuance under the 2008&nbsp;EIP and the 2008&nbsp;EIP will expire by its terms as of
June&nbsp;11, 2018. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Stockholder approval of the 2008&nbsp;EIP as amended and restated will allow us to
continue to have the ability to grant awards that qualify as &#147;performance based compensation&#148; under Code Section&nbsp;162(m). Our stockholders last approved the 2008&nbsp;EIP for purposes of allowing us to grant awards that qualify as
&#147;performance based compensation&#148; under Code Section&nbsp;162(m) at our 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Code Section&nbsp;162(m) generally denies a corporate tax deduction for annual compensation exceeding $1 million paid to the chief
executive officer and other &#147;covered employees&#148; as determined under Code Section&nbsp;162(m) and applicable guidance. However, certain types of compensation, including performance-based compensation, generally are excluded from this
deductibility limit. By approving the amended and restated 2008&nbsp;EIP, our stockholders will be approving its material terms, which include, among other things, the Share Increase and the Term Amendment. Our named executive officers and directors
have an interest in this proposal. Other than the Share Increase and Term Amendment, no material amendments have been made to the 2008&nbsp;EIP since stockholders last approved the 2008&nbsp;EIP at the Company&#146;s 2014 Annual Meeting of

of one or more Performance Goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participant&#146;s consent; provided, however, a modification to such Performance Goals only to
reflect the Successor Corporation&#146;s post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption; and (ii)&nbsp;if a payment under an Award Agreement is subject to Code Section&nbsp;409A and if
the change in control definition contained in the Award Agreement does not comply with the definition of &#147;change of control&#148; for purposes of a distribution under Code Section&nbsp;409A, then any payment of an amount that is otherwise
accelerated under this Section&nbsp;will be delayed until the earliest time that such payment would be permissible under Code Section&nbsp;409A without triggering any penalties applicable under Code Section&nbsp;409A. </P>

<U>Withholding Requirements</U>. Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company will have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount
sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes (including the Participant&#146;s FICA obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) <U>Withholding Arrangements</U>. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to
time, may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part by (without limitation) (i)&nbsp;paying cash, (ii)&nbsp;electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market
Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld, (iii)&nbsp;delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, or (iv)&nbsp;selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise
deliverable to the Participant through such means as the Administrator may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required to be withheld. The amount of the withholding requirement will be deemed
to include any amount which the Administrator agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with
respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld. </P>

Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant&#146;s relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor will they interfere in any way with the Participant&#146;s right or the Company&#146;s right to terminate such
relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">17. <U>Date of Grant</U>. The date of grant
of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant
within a reasonable time after the date of such grant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">18. <U>Effective Date and Term of Plan</U>. The Plan will become effective upon

earlier under Section&nbsp;19 of the Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">19. <U>Amendment and Termination of the Plan</U>. </P>

comply with Applicable Laws. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) <U>Effect of Amendment or Termination</U>. No amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination of the
Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect
the Administrator&#146;s ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) <U>Legal Compliance</U>. Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance
and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) <U>Investment Representations</U>. As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to
represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation
is required. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">21. <U>Inability to Obtain Authority</U>. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having
jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company&#146;s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to
which such requisite authority will not have been obtained. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* </P>
