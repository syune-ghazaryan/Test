<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of highly selective, non-absorbed drugs to treat renal,
cardiovascular, liver and metabolic diseases. Our proprietary zirconium silicate technology allows us to create highly selective ion traps that can reduce toxic levels of specific electrolytes without disturbing the balance of other electrolytes.
Our initial focus is on the development of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS-9), our product candidate for which we recently completed two Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of hyperkalemia, a life-threatening condition in which elevated
levels of potassium in the blood (greater than 5.0 mEq/L) increase the risk of muscle dysfunction, including cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We have designed our development program based on input from the United States Food and Drug
Administration, or FDA, including a recent pre-NDA meeting, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and plan to submit our New Drug Application, or NDA, in the United States in the second quarter of 2015 and our Marketing Authorization Application,
or MAA, in Europe in the second half of 2015 with the goal of obtaining approval for the treatment of acute and chronic hyperkalemia, regardless of the underlying disease state. If we receive regulatory approval, we intend to commercialize ZS-9 for
the treatment of hyperkalemia in the United States with our own specialty sales force targeting nephrologists and cardiologists and intend to seek one or more partners for commercialization in markets outside of the United States. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of March 1, 2015, we have enrolled over 1,474 patients in our clinical studies. In our ongoing long-term studies, patients have safely
received once-daily ZS-9 for over 10 months. We have completed three, double-blind, randomized placebo controlled clinical studies with ZS-9 that together enrolled 1,101 patients with hyperkalemia, including patients with chronic kidney disease
(CKD), heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes and those on renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor therapy. Our first in-man study, ZS002, was completed in May 2012 and our first Phase III study, ZS003, was completed in November 2013. Our
second Phase III study, ZS004, was completed in September 2014. All three trials met their pre-specified primary efficacy endpoints with clinically meaningful and statistically significant results. We announced the top-line results for ZS004 in
September 2014, and presented detailed primary and secondary endpoint results for ZS004 at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions on November&nbsp;17, 2014. The ZS004 study results were simultaneously published in the <I>Journal of the
American Medical Association,</I> and we announced the publication of detailed results from the ZS003 study in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> on November&nbsp;21, 2014. We initiated an extension to the ZS004 study, or ZS004e, and a
long-term safety study, ZS005, in the second quarter of 2014. We expect to file our NDA with the FDA in the second quarter of 2015 and our MAA with the EMA in the second half of 2015. </P>

and engineered to preferentially trap potassium ions. Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, or SPS (e.g., Kayexalate), the current standard of care for hyperkalemia in the United States, is a nonselective polymer resin. In contrast to nonselective polymer
resins, the potassium selectivity of ZS-9 enables high in-vitro binding capacity for potassium ions even in the presence of other competing ions. Head-to-head in-vitro experiments demonstrate that ZS-9 has roughly ten times the potassium binding
capacity of SPS. In our clinical studies to date, this selectivity has resulted in the following important differentiating characteristics for ZS-9 that we believe support its potential use to treat acute and chronic hyperkalemia: </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Hyperkalemia occurs frequently in patients with CKD, HF and type 2 diabetes, each of which has a high and increasing incidence worldwide. We
estimate the number of patients in the United States with CKD will increase from approximately 26&nbsp;million in 2009 to approximately 46&nbsp;million by 2022. Hyperkalemia can also arise from the use of RAAS inhibitors, which cause the kidney to
retain potassium, thereby increasing serum potassium levels. RAAS inhibitors (such as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEs), or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)) are commonly prescribed for patients with hypertension, HF and CKD, and
have been proven in large outcomes studies to reduce morbidity, mortality and progression of disease in these patients. As a result of these studies, RAAS inhibitors are the third most commonly prescribed class of medication in the United States.
However, RAAS inhibitors&#146; mechanism of action results in the retention of potassium, often forcing physicians to choose between the risk of hyperkalemia and the benefits of RAAS therapy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The current standard of care for hyperkalemia is SPS, which was approved in 1958 as a drug efficacy study implementation, or DESI, drug. The
safety and efficacy of SPS have never been proven in randomized, controlled trials. SPS is poorly tolerated by most patients and causes a high incidence of gastrointestinal, or GI, side effects, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, intestinal
necrosis and diarrhea, which leads to poor compliance and renders the drug unsuitable for chronic use. For patients with hyperkalemia, we believe ZS-9 represents a well-tolerated alternative to SPS that can rapidly lower and maintain serum potassium
at normal levels and may allow physicians to avoid reducing the use of RAAS inhibitors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe a significant commercial opportunity
exists for ZS-9 in the United States and internationally.&nbsp;If approved, we plan to commercialize ZS-9 in the United States with a specialty sales force focused on a subset of the approximately 5,000 practicing nephrologists and approximately
15,000 practicing non-interventional cardiologists currently treating our target patient populations. In addition, we intend to make ZS-9 available as a safe and effective therapy in the hospital setting for the rapid treatment of acute
hyperkalemia. We believe that ZS-9 will be a useful therapy to treat hyperkalemia, regardless of the underlying cause, and will allow patients to benefit from the cardio-renal protective effect of RAAS therapies. We plan to commercialize ZS-9
internationally with one or more partners. Over time, we intend to build a pipeline of product candidates using our proprietary zirconium silicate technology, which provides the opportunity to target indications susceptible to treatment by
non-absorbed binders in the GI tract. We are in nonclinical development with an ammonium binding candidate, ZS-1, which is currently being evaluated as a treatment for patients suffering from disorders associated with high blood ammonia levels, or

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Potassium plays a critical role in human physiology. It is needed for membrane activation (in order to propagate electrochemical signals
between neurons), ion and solute transport and the regulation of cell volume. Potassium is absorbed from the diet passively, while excretion of potassium is mainly a regulated active process through the kidneys. Due to fluctuations in dietary
potassium intake, the body has developed methods to retain potassium when intake is low and to increase potassium excretion when potassium intake is high. Under normal conditions, serum potassium levels are maintained in the range of 3.5 to 5.0
mEq/L by hormones such as insulin, which acts to shift potassium into cells, and aldosterone, which acts on the kidneys and the colon to stimulate the secretion of excess potassium. In healthy individuals, the kidneys excrete 90% to 95% of the
absorbed dietary potassium, with the remaining 5% to 10% excreted in the colon. Elevated potassium levels in the body can disrupt the membrane activation in cardiac cells that regulate the electrical impulses that cause the heart muscles to
contract. Decreased contraction of the cardiac tissue may cause fatal heart arrhythmias and is the main risk for patients with hyperkalemia. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Causes

impact of hyperkalemia on mortality is well documented and is a result of potassium&#146;s importance in regulating electrochemical signals in nerve and muscle cells. Cardiac arrhythmias are the leading cause of mortality in hyperkalemia patients,
and the condition can develop with few symptoms until cardiac arrhythmias manifest and hospitalization is required. Several studies have independently documented the risk of death or cardiac events associated with hyperkalemia in many different
patient populations, including those with previous acute myocardial infarctions, previously hospitalized veterans, intensive care patients, dialysis patients and veterans with HF on medication for hypertension. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The morbidity and mortality impact of hyperkalemia is significant. Hyperkalemia is detected in between 1% and 10% of all hospitalized
patients. In a 2009 study published in the <I>Archives of Internal Medicine</I>, the one-day mortality rate was up to 17 times higher for admitted patients with serum potassium above 6.0 mEq/L versus those with serum potassium less than 5.5 mEq/L.
Even patients with between 5.5 and 6.0 mEq/L of serum potassium had a one-day mortality rate six times higher than those with less than 5.5 mEq/L. </P>

increased as serum potassium levels rose above 4.5 mEq/L. This retrospective study was the largest of its kind and examined 38,689 patients from 67 hospitals over a nine-year period. The percentage of patients with in-hospital mortality or

events and mortality. We believe that a well-tolerated treatment that effectively lowers and maintains normal levels of serum potassium would provide significant clinical benefits to these patients and reduce their risk of mortality and cardiac
events. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additional studies have provided further evidence that reducing excess serum potassium levels in hyperkalemia patients reduces
mortality risk. One study found reduced serum potassium levels resulting from common therapies led to a statistically significant increase in survival rates. Another study, in hospitalized patients receiving critical care, showed that the reduction
of serum potassium by more than 1 mEq/L 48 hours after hospitalization decreases the risk of patient mortality. These studies suggest that treating hyperkalemia in the acute and chronic settings can have a significant impact on patient outcomes by
reducing the risk of death. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cardio-Renal Protective RAAS Inhibitor Therapy is Limited by Hyperkalemia </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Maximum doses of RAAS inhibitors are widely recommended for patients with hypertension, HF, CKD and type 2 diabetes in order to regulate blood
pressure. Large outcomes studies have shown that RAAS inhibitors can significantly decrease hospitalization, morbidity and mortality in these patients. However, inhibition of the RAAS pathway also promotes potassium retention by reducing
aldosterone, a hormone involved in potassium secretion, leading to hyperkalemia. As a consequence, physicians are often forced to make the choice between the risk of hyperkalemia and the benefits of RAAS inhibitor therapy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Outcomes Studies Demonstrate the Importance of RAAS Inhibitor Therapy </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Large outcomes studies have demonstrated that RAAS inhibitors significantly improve the health of patients. RAAS inhibitors reduce mortality
and hospitalization rates in HF patients by improving heart function. The inhibitors also reduce all-cause mortality by minimizing damage to secondary organs such as the kidneys and delaying the progression of type 2 diabetes. A prominent study, the
Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study, or RALES, in HF patients showed a significant reduction in death and hospitalization with the aldosterone inhibitor spironolactone and demonstrated that dose optimization plays a significant role in the
efficacy of these drugs. Patients receiving spironolactone had a much higher probability of survival, especially at later time points after treatment began. Overall the risk of death was 30% lower in the spironolactone group compared to the placebo
group. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Both the rate of admission for hyperkalemia and the rate of in-hospital death attributed to hyperkalemia increased following the
publication of RALES. The rate of hospital admission due to hyperkalemia increased dramatically from a rate of 2.4&nbsp;per 1000 patients prior to RALES to approximately 11&nbsp;per 1000 in the two years following RALES publication (p&lt;0.001).
Furthermore, the rate of in-hospital death from hyperkalemia increased from approximately 0.3&nbsp;per 1000 patients to 2&nbsp;per 1000 patients after RALES (p&lt;0.001). These data are not surprising given the effect of RAAS inhibitors, such as
spironolactone, on potassium retention and the association of hyperkalemia with mortality. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial
Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study, or EPHESUS, a 6,632 patient randomized, placebo-controlled study published in 2003 described the benefit of eplerenone, an aldosterone blocker, on mortality and morbidity in patients with HF who
had a previous myocardial infarction. Another study, the Reduction of Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (or adult-onset or type 2 diabetes) with the Angiotension II Antagonist Losartan, which is referred to as the RENAAL study,
demonstrated that the use of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan resulted in a 28% reduction in progression to end-stage renal disease, corresponding to a two year delay in reaching end-stage renal disease and reduced hospitalization in
type&nbsp;2 diabetics. This trial specifically highlights the benefits of RAAS inhibition on non-heart conditions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of these

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A 2012 study published in the <I>American Journal of Cardiology</I> in 2012 found that hyperkalemia is the top predictor of all-cause mortality
in cardiovascular patients with CKD on anti-hypertensive drugs. Historically, hyperkalemia has been seen as secondary to more serious conditions such as CKD or HF. However, as illustrated in the graph below, hyperkalemia was found to be more likely
than factors such as age, hospitalization or CKD stage to predict mortality in cardiovascular disease patients with CKD receiving antihypertensive drugs, indicating that hyperkalemia is an independent predictor of mortality separate from other
conditions such as CKD or HF. In the graph below, an odds ratio in excess of 1 illustrates a positive correlation between the underlying risk factor and the resulting co-morbidity, or mortality in this case. Generally, a higher odds ratio signifies
an increased risk of mortality due to the corresponding underlying risk. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>Predictors of All-cause Mortality in Cardiovascular Disease

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Due to the risk of hyperkalemia, a large percentage of patients are either not treated with RAAS inhibitor therapy, or are undertreated,
despite clear guideline recommendations and proven patient benefit. According to articles in the <I>American Heart Journal</I> and the <I>European Heart Journal</I>, over 50% of HF patients are on suboptimal RAAS inhibitor doses and up to 15% of HF
patients are not on RAAS inhibitor treatment at all. In CKD patients with type 2 diabetes, over 70% are not treated or are being treated below the recommended dose. The 2012 U.S. Renal Data Survey shows that RAAS inhibitor usage in the Medicare
population declines as CKD stage progresses and suggests this decline is likely due to the impact of hyperkalemia. The graph below shows the percentage of patients on ACE inhibitors or ARBs for 2007 and 2010. Although the percentage of patients
using ACE inhibitors or ARBs, a RAAS inhibitor, increased from 2007 to 2010, there was an approximate 20% decline in the patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD who were taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs as compared to patients in earlier stages of the disease.
We believe a well-tolerated and effective potassium-reducing agent would allow patients to avoid the hyperkalemia associated with RAAS therapy while receiving the full benefit of these medications, including reduced mortality and slowed progression
to end stage renal disease. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the hospital setting, hyperkalemia is currently treated with drugs that support heart function and temporarily reduce serum potassium by
shifting potassium into the cells. However, no treatment is currently available to effectively and safely remove excess potassium and maintain normal levels of serum potassium. SPS (e.g., Kayexalate), which was approved in 1958 as a DESI drug, is
the current standard of care for potassium reduction, but its safety and efficacy have never been proven in randomized, controlled trials. SPS is poorly tolerated by most patients and causes a high incidence of GI side effects, including nausea,
vomiting, constipation, intestinal necrosis and diarrhea, which leads to poor compliance and renders the drug unsuitable for chronic use. In addition, in 2009, the FDA issued a warning for colonic necrosis that sparked a debate in the medical
community on whether SPS should ever be used. Low potassium diets are widely prescribed, but enforcing compliance is difficult and, as the underlying disease biology progresses, dietary restrictions become ineffective. For patients on RAAS
inhibitors, limiting or removing RAAS medications decreases potassium, but puts patients at a higher risk of mortality and/or more rapid disease progression due to uncontrolled hypertension. Given the widely recognized limitations of existing
therapies, we believe that there is a significant unmet need and market for a well-tolerated, effective treatment for hyperkalemia. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Key Properties of

and engineered to preferentially trap potassium ions throughout the GI tract. We are developing ZS-9 to be administered orally at doses of 10g given three times per day to treat acute hyperkalemia and at doses of 5g to 15g given once per day to
prevent the reoccurrence of hyperkalemia. The compound is made via a two-step, proprietary manufacturing process using readily available starting materials. ZS-9 is formulated as a room temperature, stable, dry, odorless, tasteless powder that is
filled into packets or bottles or pressed into a dissolvable tablet and is easily suspendable in small amounts of water (40-120 mL). Another formulation of ZS-9 that we are developing is an enema for pediatric and hospital use. In our clinical
studies to date, we have observed that ZS-9 acts as soon as one hour after administration of a 10g dose and that once daily administration maintains normal potassium levels for 28 days in our ZS004 Phase III study and over 10 months in our long-term
safety studies. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have designed ZS-9 to efficiently bind and remove potassium from the body thereby reducing serum potassium levels and treating hyperkalemia.
ZS-9 is a microporous zirconium silicate compound comprised of zirconium, silicon and oxygen atoms covalently bound to one another and arranged to form ion-binding pores that exchange hydrogen and sodium for potassium. The figure below shows an
atomic depiction of the ion binding pores as well as the ionic diameter of some common ions, with each image in the figure depicting a reduction in scale. </P>

larger ions such as magnesium, calcium and sodium, and thus the compound can preferentially trap potassium even in the presence of other positive ions. In contrast, organic polymers like SPS are non-selective and bind potassium only in areas of high
potassium concentration like the colon, thus the onset of activity is dependent on gastrointestinal transit time and begins hours to days after administration. This inherent difference in selectivity was demonstrated in-vitro by comparing the
binding of ZS-9 and SPS in the presence of potassium (K<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">+</SUP>), calcium (Ca<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">2+</SUP>) and magnesium
(Mg<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">2+</SUP>) ions at a 1:1:1 ratio. Whereas SPS shows a preference for Ca<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">2+</SUP> over K<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">+</SUP> or Mg<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">2+</SUP>, ZS-9 is nearly 100% selective for K<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">+</SUP> (depicted in the figure below). Based on these in vitro studies, ZS-9 has approximately ten times the total

ingestion and throughout the GI tract, even in locations where potassium is not the most abundant ion. In our clinical studies to date this selectivity has resulted in the following important differentiating characteristics for ZS-9: high efficacy
in patients treated in our studies to date at modest dose amounts; a rapid onset of action as soon as one hour after a 10g dose by acting early in the GI tract where potassium is not the most abundant ion; and well tolerated with no material effect
on other important electrolytes that are critical for normal human function. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion, or ADME, and

ZS-9 is insoluble in typical solvents and passes through the GI tract without degradation. The compound does not swell in the presence of water, enabling it to be effectively eliminated from the body without the need for a laxative to avoid
constipation caused by organic polymers such as SPS. ZS-9 is thermally stable and does not require refrigeration or any special handling. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, we have not observed evidence of ZS-9 absorption in animals or humans. ZS-9 is substantially in a spherical form, having an average
diameter of approximately 20 to 30 micrometers, which is too large to be absorbed into the body. We conducted in-vivo recovery studies in rats which recovered greater than 98% of the dosage of ZS-9 administered, similar to the level of recovery of
the control compound. In addition, high sensitivity analysis of samples collected from 6 month rat, 9 month dog, and 28 day human studies have shown no sign of ZS-9 absorption with a limit of detection of 10 parts per 1,000,000,000. We believe these
studies provide evidence that ZS-9 is excreted in feces and is not systemically absorbed. In addition, we believe ZS-9 is essentially insoluble under physiologic conditions. Exposure of the powder form of ZS-9 to simulated gastric and intestinal
fluids for an extended period of time resulted in negligible increases in the levels of zirconium, silicon and oxygen in solution. These experiments suggest that the amount of zirconium available for absorption from a 10g dose of ZS-9 would be
0.00028 mg. Compared to the average range of between 1.0 and 9.0 mg of zirconium found in the average daily human diet, ZS-9 is not expected to be a significant source of dietary zirconium intake. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, zirconium has a long safety history in biomedical applications including hip and knee implants and nephrology applications such
as hemofiltration, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and in the design and construction of wearable artificial kidneys. Notably zirconium containing sorbent columns have been used in over 6,000,000 dialysis sessions since the 1970&#146;s without
safety issues and zirconium containing sorbent columns are currently being developed by Fresenius, a leading dialysis provider. In sorbent hemodialysis sessions, patients with CKD with little or no kidney function have their blood exposed directly
to zirconium containing columns. The amount of zirconium directly released into the blood of patients during each session has been quantified to be 0.758 mg, or almost 3,000 times that which could be absorbed from a 10g dose of ZS-9. Zirconium is

through a clinical development program with the goal of obtaining approval for the treatment of acute and chronic hyperkalemia, regardless of the underlying cause. We submitted an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for ZS-9 as a treatment
for hyperkalemia with, and such application was acknowledged by, the FDA in December 2010. As of March&nbsp;1, 2015, our clinical program has enrolled 1,474 patients, which is representative of the hyperkalemia population, including patients with
CKD, HF, type 2 diabetes and those on RAAS inhibitor therapy. We have completed ZS002, ZS003 and ZS004, which resulted in positive Phase II and Phase&nbsp;III data. We initiated an 11 month extension to the ZS004 study, ZS004e, and a 12 month
long-term safety study, ZS005, in the second quarter of 2014. We received guidance from the FDA on the non clinical requirements and clinical program for the development of ZS-9, including a recent pre NDA meeting, and we believe that we have
incorporated this guidance into our development program. As is typically the case, the FDA may provide additional guidance or change its guidance as our drug candidates move through development, clinical trials and the regulatory approval process.
We plan to submit our NDA in the second quarter of 2015 and MAA in the second half of 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, daily administration of ZS-9 has
been observed to lower, and maintain control of, serum potassium levels while maintaining a favorable tolerability profile. The acute portion of our most recent pivotal Phase III trial, ZS004, showed clinically meaningful reductions in serum
potassium that were statistically significant, with a median time to normalization of 2.2 hours, and 84% and 98% of subjects becoming normokalemic after receiving 10g of ZS-9 three times a day for 24 and 48 hours, respectively. In addition, the
extension portion of this trial demonstrated that the reductions achieved in the acute phase could be maintained in 80%, 90%, and 94% of patients using 5g, 10g, or 15g of ZS-9 administered once daily, respectively. These results were statistically
significant when compared to patients randomized to placebo who had their potassium level revert to near pretreatment levels. These positive results are supported by results from our Phase II study, ZS002, and our first Phase III study, ZS003, which
also showed statistically significant reductions in serum potassium levels, with 99% of patients becoming normokalemic after receiving 10g of ZS-9 given three times a day for 48 hours, and sustained potassium reductions in patients using 5g and 10g
of ZS-9 administered once daily. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, ZS-9 was observed to have a favorable safety profile and was well-tolerated across trial

completed trials, the most common adverse events were mild-to-moderate GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhea. These events occurred at a similar rate and severity as
placebo treated patients. No serious adverse events were deemed attributable to ZS-9. In contrast, the product label of SPS, the only approved potassium-binding treatment, includes warnings of severe GI side effects which can be fatal, including GI
necrosis, bleeding and perforation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that the NDA and MAA will include the results from the Phase II trial (ZS002), the Phase
III trial (ZS003) and the Phase III one month randomized withdrawal study, ZS004. We expect to include safety data from the long-term studies ZS004e and ZS005 as part of our submission package and provide updates at regular intervals during FDA
review. The ZS002 study and both Phase III studies were published in peer reviewed journals, the ZS002 study was published in <I>Kidney International</I>, the ZS003 study was published in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> (NEJM) and the
ZS004 study was published in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I> (JAMA). If all of the planned studies are completed (ZS002, ZS003, ZS004 and ZS005), approximately 1,500 patients will have been exposed to ZS-9. We discussed the
design of these studies and the adequacy of our proposed clinical package with the FDA in our recent pre NDA meeting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Clinical Program </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The table below summarizes our clinical development program for ZS-9, which began with ZS002, a dose escalating, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled Phase II study in hyperkalemic patients with CKD, including those on RAAS inhibitor therapy, in November 2011. Following the positive results of this trial, we conducted ZS003, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase
III study in a representative population of hyperkalemic patients including those with CKD, HF, type 2 diabetes and those on RAAS therapy. The goal of this study was to confirm the acute findings observed in our ZS002 Phase II study and explore
ZS-9&#146;s ability to maintain normal levels of serum potassium for an extended period regardless of etiology. Following the positive results of this trial, we conducted ZS004, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study in
patients with higher baseline potassium levels, including those with CKD, HF, type 2 diabetes and those on RAAS therapy. The goal of this study was to establish the dose for once daily maintenance treatment and explore ZS-9&#146;s ability to
maintain normal levels of serum potassium in patients with higher baseline potassium levels over a longer time period. We recently reported clinically meaningful and statistically significant results from ZS004 and have initiated two additional
studies to explore long-term treatment with ZS-9. The first study, ZS004e, is an 11 month open label extension study for subjects completing ZS004 and the second study, ZS005, is a 12 month exposure study designed to establish long-term safety and
efficacy. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

that ZS-9 is safe and well-tolerated. Adverse events potentially related to ZS-9 have primarily been mild-to-moderate transient GI symptoms in approximately 5% of subjects, a rate comparable to placebo. In one study, the ZS004 study,
mild-to-moderate cases of edema were observed in approximately 2% to 14% of subjects; however rates of edema from our ongoing 12 month long-term studies are lower and comparable to placebo rates observed in previous studies. Only one serious adverse
event was assessed as being possibly related to study drug (a case of gastroenteritis in ZS003), but when the study was unblinded, the patient who experienced the serious adverse event was found to have received placebo. All other serious adverse
events reported to date have been assessed as unrelated to ZS-9. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Phase II Study </I></B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In this first trial, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that tested three doses of ZS-9 in 90 patients with CKD
(as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (a measurement of overall renal function), or eGFR, of 30-60 mL/min, which corresponds to Stage 3 CKD) and with mild to moderate hyperkalemia (5.0-6.0 mEq/L). For patient safety reasons, patients
with serum potassium levels over 6.0 mEq/L were not allowed to participate in the study due to the potential that such patients would receive placebo. The study was designed to explore ZS-9&#146;s ability to rapidly treat hyperkalemia. Patients
received 0.3, 3 or 10g of ZS-9 or placebo three times daily with meals for 48 hours. Potassium levels were measured at multiple time points during the 48 hour treatment phase as well as once daily during the five day follow up period. The primary
endpoint of the study was the rate of change in serum potassium over 48 hours. The study design is illustrated in the figure below. </P>

and those on RAAS inhibitor therapy. Results of the study were initially presented at a symposium at the American Society of Nephrology and were later published in the<I> New England Journal of Medicine</I>. The study was designed to confirm
ZS-9&#146;s ability to rapidly treat hyperkalemia in the induction phase and to maintain normokalemia in the maintenance phase. Patients were randomized to receive one of four doses of ZS-9 (1.25g, 2.5g, 5g or 10g) or placebo, administered three
times daily for the initial 48 hours, or the induction phase. The primary endpoint was the rate of change in serum potassium from baseline throughout the 48 hour induction phase, which was the same primary endpoint used in the ZS002 study. Patients
that normalized at a potassium level between 3.5 and 5.0&nbsp;mEq/L in the induction phase were then randomized to active drug (1.25g, 2.5g, 5g or 10g) or placebo administered once-daily for 12 days during the maintenance phase. The endpoint for the

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ZS-9 was equally efficacious across patient subsets. Patients with CKD, HF, type 2 diabetes and
those taking RAAS inhibitor therapy all received the same magnitude of potassium lowering as the entire intent to treat, or ITT, population. In contrast, subjects with higher starting potassium levels had a higher response to <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ZS-9.</FONT> Patients with pretreatment potassium levels in excess of 5.5 mEq/L (average baseline 5.84 mEq/L) saw an average decrease of 1.1 mEq/L at 48 hours while those with starting potassium levels at or below 5.3
mEq/L had an average decrease of 0.6 mEq/L at the highest dose. We believe that ZS-9 works in conjunction with normal potassium excretion mechanisms to remove potassium when it is above 5.0 mEq/L, but as serum potassium drops below 5.0 mEq/L, the
body lowers physiologic excretion to avoid hypokalemia, defined as serum potassium level below 3.5 mEq/L. This may explain why hypokalemia has been rare within the dose range administered despite ZS-9&#146;s rapid and potent ability to remove
potassium. In study ZS003, hypokalemia occurred in only two patients (0.3% of all enrolled patients) in the induction and maintenance phases. Even in those two cases, the hypokalemia was mild (3.1 and 3.4 mEq/L, respectively), transient and did not
require any treatment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>Study ZS003: Reduction in Serum Potassium Levels Across Patient Subgroups </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The maintenance portion of our Phase III study was a randomized withdrawal design. Patients that became normokalemic after receiving ZS-9
during the induction phase were re-randomized to receive once daily placebo or once daily ZS-9 at the same dose level as they had received three times daily during the induction phase. Thus, patients who had received 10g three times per day in the
induction phase were randomized to receive 10g of ZS-9 once per day or 10g of placebo once per day. Results from the maintenance portion of the Phase III study were released in January 2014. The results from this portion of the study met the
predefined efficacy endpoints at the 5g and 10g doses when compared with their respective placebo groups (p=0.0075 and &lt;0.0001). Patients who received 5g of ZS-9 once daily during the maintenance portion had an increase of 0.11 mEq/L compared to
a placebo increase of serum potassium levels of 0.25 mEq/L. Patients who received 10g of ZS-9 once daily during the maintenance portion had an increase in average potassium levels of 0.06&nbsp;mEq/L compared to an average increase in placebo
patients of 0.58 mEq/L. At the end of the maintenance period, when ZS-9 was no longer administered, average potassium levels increased to near baseline levels, similar to the levels in those patients that received placebo during the maintenance
portion. </P>

of GI adverse events seen with SPS, we believe the low incidence of reported GI adverse events in the study is of particular note. For example, the highest dose tested during the dose intensive induction phase, 10g of ZS-9 given three times per day
(30g per day), displayed a GI event rate of 3.5% </P>

relative to a placebo rate of 5%. Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, were observed more frequently in ZS-9 treated patients than those receiving placebo, however the UTIs did not appear to be
dose related, the overall incidence was consistent with what would be expected in a patient population with significant co-morbidities such as CKD, type 2 diabetes, and HF, and more ZS-9 treated patients had urinary tract infections at the
initiation of the study than the patients receiving placebo which may explain this finding. In our most recent completed study, ZS004, UTIs occurred at the same rate as placebo. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In general, there were no clinically meaningful treatment-related changes in most laboratory parameters.
Hypokalemia (defined in this trial as a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L) occurred in two subjects out of the 753 subjects in the study (0.3% of all enrolled patients), none of whom had any complications related to hypokalemia. In both
cases, hypokalemia was mild (3.4 and 3.1 mEq/L, respectively), transient and did not require any treatment. No statistically significant changes in serum sodium or magnesium levels were observed. There was a small decrease in the average serum
calcium levels in the ZS-9 group that was statistically different to the mean change from baseline in the placebo group at the highest doses tested. These changes were deemed not to be clinically significant and all patients remained in the normal
range. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Adverse events were generally mild or moderate and transient in nature. There were a total of 16 serious adverse events reported
in the study, 15 of which were assessed by the study investigators and by us as not related to ZS-9. Only one serious adverse event, a case of gastroenteritis, was classified as being possibly related to study drug; however, when the data was
unblinded, this event occurred in a patient treated with placebo. The remaining 15 non-related serious adverse events were well distributed between ZS-9 and placebo, and there was no dose dependent relationship within the four ZS treatment groups.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ZS004, also known as the HARMONIZE study, was a two part double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, pivotal Phase III withdrawal study
designed to confirm the dosing for chronic administration of ZS-9. The results of the trial were presented on November&nbsp;17, 2014 at a symposium at the American Heart Association meeting and simultaneously published in the <I>Journal of the
American Medical Association</I>. The trial consisted of an open label induction phase followed by a month long randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal phase. In the open-label acute phase of the study, 258 patients received 10g of
ZS-9 administered three times daily with meals for 48 hours and were monitored to establish the speed and magnitude of serum K+ reduction. Then, patients who achieved normokalemia (K+ levels between 3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L) were randomized in a
double-blind fashion to one of three doses of ZS-9 (5g (N=45), 10g (N=51), or 15g (N=56)) or placebo (N=85) administered once-daily for 28 days (the double-blind randomized withdrawal phase). The primary efficacy endpoint compared the mean serum K+
level of each ZS-9 treatment group to that of placebo over the interval between day 8 and day 29 of the double-blind randomized withdrawal phase. Key secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion of patients with mean K+ &lt;5.1 mEq/L between
day 8 and day 29, median time to normalization, change from baseline in serum K+ and the proportion of patients achieving normokalemia. Patients who completed this initial 28-day randomized phase were eligible to enroll in an ongoing 11 month
open-label extension study, ZS004e. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Demographics of the patient population enrolled in the pivotal Phase III trial were substantially the same as that studied in the previous
Phase II and Phase III trials, however given the efficacy observed in previous studies, patients were permitted entry into the study even with potassium levels in excess of 6.5 mEq/L, the range of baseline potassium levels was 5.1-7.4 mEq/L. We
believe the ZS004 trial tested a representative population of hyperkalemic patients, which included those with CKD (eGFR&lt;60mL/min/1.73m2; 69%), HF (NYHA Class <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">I-IV;</FONT> 36%), type 2 diabetes (66%)&nbsp;and
those on RAAS inhibitor therapy (70%)&nbsp;from a range of ethnic backgrounds (white (83%); African American (14%); Asian (2%); other (1%)). The demographic and other baseline characteristics of subjects treated in the Maintenance Phase were
generally similar among the Maintenance Phase treatment groups. The pivotal Phase III trial was conducted at 49 clinical sites in the United States, Australia and South Africa. Enrollment was completed within four months, suggesting the high
prevalence of hyperkalemia, with approximately 80% of patients from the United States. </P>

more frequent on ZS-9. There were six cases of constipation on placebo (7.1%)&nbsp;compared to no cases on 5g, one case on 10g (2.0%), and one case on 15g (1.8%). There were 14 cases of edema:
two cases of edema on placebo (2.4%), one case on 5g (2.2%), three cases on 10g (5.9%), and eight cases on 15g (14.3%). Seven cases of edema resolved or did not require treatment during study (one case on 5g, all three cases on 10g, and three cases
on 15g). Of the 14 patients with edema, 13 completed the study. Each of the subjects who had edema events were receiving multiple types of medications for treatment of hypertension, of which edema is a common adverse effect. The majority of the
subjects also had CKD and most had a medical history of edema. None of the edema events were considered related to ZS-9, and most were mild or moderate in severity. This conclusion is supported by data from the long term ZS004e and ZS005 extension
studies which to date do not show an increased rate of edema at 15g, or any other dose, after ten months of treatment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In general, there
were no clinically meaningful treatment-related changes in most laboratory parameters. There were five cases of hypokalemia (defined in this trial as a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L) on 10g (9.8%)&nbsp;and six cases on 15g (10.7%), all
of which occurred in the extended phase, compared to no cases on both placebo and 5g. All cases of hypokalemia were transient, mild (3.0 to 3.4 mEq/L), and resolved after the dose of ZS-9 was reduced from daily to every other day (per protocol) for
the remainder of the study. There were dose-related mean increases from baseline in serum bicarbonate after treatment with 10g and 15g of ZS-9 that were statistically significantly different from the placebo group. The restoration of normal
bicarbonate levels may provide additional benefit to this population, which often suffer from metabolic acidosis, and will be monitored in ongoing trials. No patients had bicarbonate levels that went out of the normal range. At the end of treatment
in the Maintenance Phase, statistically significant larger mean decreases from baseline in serum aldosterone were observed in each of the ZS dose groups (range: -3.68 to -6.12 ng/dL) compared with the placebo group (-0.83 ng/dL). No statistically
significant changes in serum sodium, serum calcium, or serum magnesium levels were observed, and none of the subjects developed clinically significantly lower values for calcium or magnesium or high values for sodium. No clinically important changes
in other laboratory values were observed. In addition, there were no dose-related changes in urinary excretion of sodium between the treatment groups, despite significant reductions in urinary potassium, suggesting that there was little or no sodium
absorbed from ZS-9. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Ongoing Studies </I></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, we have not observed evidence of ZS-9 absorption in animals or humans. We conducted in-vivo recovery studies in rats which recovered
greater than 98% of the dosage of ZS-9 administered, similar to the level of recovery of the control compound. In addition, high sensitivity analysis of samples collected from 6 month rat, 9 month dog, and 28 day human studies have shown no sign of
ZS-9 absorption with a limit of detection of 10 parts per 1,000,000,000. We believe these studies provide evidence that ZS-9 is excreted in feces and is not systemically absorbed. In addition, we believe ZS-9 is essentially insoluble under
physiologic conditions. Exposure of the powder form of ZS-9 to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids for an extended period of time resulted in negligible increases in the levels of zirconium, silicon and oxygen in solution. These experiments
suggest that the amount of zirconium available for absorption from a 10g dose of ZS-9 would be 0.00028 mg. Compared to the average range of between 1.0 and 9.0 mg of zirconium found in the average daily human diet, ZS-9 is not expected to be a
significant source of dietary zirconium intake. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Nonclinical pharmacology studies have shown that ZS-9 binds potassium in solution as well
as in complex environments, such as in-vivo animal models. Nonclinical safety data showed that ZS-9 was not genotoxic and was not associated with adverse effects in cardiovascular, central nervous system or gastrointestinal motility safety
pharmacology studies. Results of preliminary nonclinical drug-to-drug interaction studies indicated that ZS-9 did not interfere with the absorption of common drugs used in our target patient population when evaluated

ZS-1 has been designed to trap ammonium ions and is currently being evaluated as a treatment for disorders where elevated ammonium levels are thought to play a role. We have developed a nonclinical and clinical plan, but we have not yet initiated

CKD and HF are the major populations at risk for chronic hyperkalemia due to poor renal function and/or the need for treatment with RAAS inhibitors. Together, there are over 30&nbsp;million CKD and HF patients in the United States, which number is
expected to grow to nearly 50&nbsp;million patients by 2022. We believe a significant commercial opportunity exists for ZS-9, and, subject to FDA approval, we plan to initially market ZS-9 in the United States to a subset of the approximately 5,000
practicing nephrologists and approximately 15,000 practicing non-interventional cardiologists, who treat patients in one or more of the following categories: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

stage 4 CKD patients, respectively. Therefore, we estimate that there are approximately 2.4&nbsp;million CKD patients in the United States with moderate-to-severe hyperkalemia being treated by a nephrologist or cardiologist. Based on our market
research, approximately 80% of physicians surveyed indicated that they are likely to intervene with some form of treatment for hyperkalemia when a patient&#146;s serum potassium level reaches 5.5 mEq/L. Accordingly, we view these patients as a
readily identifiable initial patient population likely to be prescribed ZS-9. We believe that a safe, effective and well-tolerated daily use chronic therapy such as ZS-9 would be useful for patients in this category, in particular for those patients
who have a history of recurrent episodes of hyperkalemia. </TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

multi-year surveys conducted between 1999 and 2004 for CKD and between 2005 and 2008 for HF, when applied to 2010 U.S. Census Data, we estimate there are approximately 19&nbsp;million stage 3 or 4 CKD patients and approximately 5.7&nbsp;million HF
patients in the United States. Based on our market research and medical literature, 80% of these patients who are under the care of a nephrologist or cardiologist are indicated for RAAS therapy, yet nearly half of these patients are not receiving
RAAS inhibitors or are receiving sub-optimal RAAS inhibitor dosing, in large part because they have developed, or physicians fear that they will develop, hyperkalemia from these treatments. Current CKD and HF treatment guidelines recommend the use
of RAAS inhibitors to preserve kidney function and delay time to dialysis in CKD patients and decrease morbidity and mortality in HF patients. We believe that, with the introduction of a safe, effective and well-tolerated daily use chronic treatment
option for hyperkalemia, some physicians may increase their RAAS inhibitor usage in patients who have hyperkalemia by either maintaining their RAAS inhibitor therapy, increasing the doses of RAAS inhibitor where indicated or by reinitiating RAAS
inhibitor medications. We believe that ZS-9 would provide physicians with an important tool to treat such hyperkalemia in this patient population. </TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other companies are developing drugs for the treatment of hyperkalemia. We are aware of one other company, Relypsa, which is developing a
hyperkalemia treatment, Patiromer, for which it has announced that it has completed its Phase III clinical development program and it has submitted an NDA to the FDA that has been accepted. If approved by the FDA, this treatment could reach the US
market before ZS-9, potentially giving Relypsa an advantage over us in marketing and gaining market acceptance. In order to compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate that the treatment of hyperkalemia with ZS-9 is a superior
alternative to existing or new therapies for hyperkalemia, including Patiromer. Even if we are able to demonstrate the superiority of our product, Relypsa or other competitors may attempt to lock us out of the market by entering into exclusive or
preferred arrangements with insurers and other third party payors before our product is approved for sale, which may make it difficult for us to successfully gain market acceptance for ZS-9. In addition, our competitors may attempt to undercut our
pricing for ZS-9 once it is introduced, or we may need to undercut the pricing of Relypsa&#146;s drug to gain market acceptance, which could also harm our results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the current treatment options for the chronic management of hyperkalemia are limited. These options include dietary
potassium restriction, potassium-wasting diuretics or SPS. Dietary potassium restriction is difficult due to the ubiquitous presence of potassium in foods. Because fat, carbohydrates (in diabetics), sodium and phosphorus tend to be restricted in CKD
patients, the addition of potassium restriction severely limits food options for these patients, which results in significant patient compliance issues. Diuretics, a mainstay for managing sodium, water balance and hypertension, are highly efficient
at removing potassium in patients with normal renal function; however, the effectiveness of these drugs is greatly diminished in patients with CKD. SPS&#146; efficacy is unproven in large randomized controlled trials and its product labeling
includes warnings of serious and potentially fatal GI side effects, and therefore, we believe that its use as a daily treatment option over the long-term is limited. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address CKD, HF and metabolic diseases. While
we are not aware of any direct competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in development of drugs to treat hyperkalemia, other than Relypsa, we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies that are researching and selling products to treat CKD, HF and metabolic diseases. Many of our competitors have materially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources than we do.

Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in nonclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs and commercializing drugs upon approval.
In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ZS-9 is stable at room temperature and does not absorb or attract high levels of moisture from the air. ZS-9 does not require any special
handling. The ongoing 36-month stability studies supporting our powder formulation are expected to provide 24 months of data to support the NDA filing. We expect that these data will support the storage of ZS-9 for 36 months at 25&deg;C. ZS-9
tablets are also being tested in 36 month stability studies, and we believe that these studies will support storage of ZS-9 tablets for 24 to 36 months at 25&deg;C. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ZS-9 is manufactured at our two manufacturing facilities located in Coppell, Texas and in Denver, Colorado. ZS-9, the drug product, is a dry,
odorless powder or tablet formulation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API. The API is manufactured in a straightforward two-step process from readily available starting materials. The initial phase involves mixing silicate solution,
zirconium acetate and sodium hydroxide in water at high temperature and at elevated pressures. By carefully selecting the reaction conditions we are able to form&nbsp;ZS-9 with the appropriate particle size and particle size distribution. The
resulting crystalline material is then washed with an acidic solution to improve the potassium exchange kinetics and reduce the API&#146;s pH. For the powder drug product, the resulting API is filled into packets, a well-established configuration
for oral suspension. For the tablet formulation, the API is blended with binding agents and pressed into tablets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We completed
manufacturing of registration batches of ZS-9 with a reactor that has approximately one fourth the capacity of our anticipated commercial scale reactor and are producing commercial grade ZS-9 from our 2,000 liter (commercial scale) reactor. We
received delivery of a second 2,000 liter commercial scale reactor in the fourth quarter of 2014. Registration batches were used for our pivotal Phase III trials and ongoing stability studies. We have completed development of most analytical methods
for impurities and commercial release testing, and we are now validating those methods. We have completed testing for impurities in drug substance registration stability batches and clinical batches using analytical procedures developed in-house and
have found that the purity of our drug substance is high. We believe the levels of impurities are below the suggested guidance recommendations. Control of impurities during API and drug product manufacturing will be confirmed through process
validation; we are using the maximum daily dose to establish the allowable levels of genotoxic impurities, impurities of special toxicological concern and residual solvents. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To meet our strategic objectives, which contemplate internally manufacturing all of our drug substance to support anticipated commercial
demand if ZS-9 is approved, we plan to install additional reactors, dryers and other equipment, add manufacturing personnel and ensure that validated processes are consistently implemented in our facilities. In particular, we currently intend to
eventually transition to use a 5,000 liter reactor to produce ZS-9 and there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully do so. Should we encounter unexpected difficulties in transitioning to these larger reactors, we may be forced to rely
on 2,000 liter reactors, which could both increase our expected costs and impact the timing of our ability to expand our production. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
plan to continue to manufacture ZS-9 API in our two manufacturing sites to establish a diverse and volume appropriate supply. This material will then be sent to finished product manufacturers for further processing and drug product completion. Our
current manufacturing capacity is insufficient to meet peak anticipated market demand; however we plan to produce quantities sufficient for launch and increase production capacity post approval. We believe our strategy to build in-house API
manufacturing will allow us to ensure adequate supply of API and attain an attractive cost of goods structure from the time of launch if ZS-9 is approved. </P>

ZS-9 production method can be controlled to reduce the levels of more soluble forms of zirconium silicate impurities in the composition. We have been issued three U.S. patents based on improvements with composition of matter and method of use claims

extension will be available under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, for one of the patents we intend to list in the Orange Book if ZS-9 receives FDA approval and if certain eligibility
requirements are met, as ZS-9 is a new chemical entity (NCE) that the FDA has not previously approved. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for a maximum patent term extension of five years from the expiration date of the subject patent as compensation for
patent term lost in the product development and regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond 14-years from the approval date and only one patent applicable to a regulatory review period for a
product may be extended. If all regulatory requirements are met and maintenance fees are paid, the maximum patent term extension available for the method of treatment patent would result in a term expiring in 2024. </P>

the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used.
Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB or ethics committee for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and
the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable
health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, including the requirements for informed consent. </P>

under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the

significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not
bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical
data or an additional Phase III clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret
data differently than we interpret data. Once the FDA approves an NDA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the drug reaches the market.
Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such drug or require a recall of any drug already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance

manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or
possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially
subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the
Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the
Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Act, as amended, or the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, as amended, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA and similar state
laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to
authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition
laws. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As noted above, in the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare &#147;fraud and
abuse,&#148; including, but not limited to, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug
manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, for
which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in
federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal
healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change
in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with physicians might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we intend to commercialize products that could be
reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which
we will or may become subject. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for
payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services.
Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#147;cause&#148; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding
information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information
and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the
federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation </P>

include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from
participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege
that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False
Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are also an increasing number of state
laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar federal requirement
requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by
imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon
federal, authorities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act </I></B></P>

states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer&#146;s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical
manufacturers&#146; rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for
&#147;line extensions&#148; (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. PPACA
raised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for outpatient drugs are calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of
prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well. In addition,
PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition
cost data, which could negatively impact our sales. </TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, PPACA expanded the types of
entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children&#146;s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan
drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount
to increase. </TD></TR></TABLE>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Pharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative
undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. To date, we have focused principally on developing ZS-9, which is our only product candidate in clinical development. We have no approved drug product and as a result have not generated any
revenue from product sales to date and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in February 2008. We have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, we have limited experience
and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. We continue to incur
significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Our research and development costs for the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $45.6 million, $24.8 million and $7.0 million,
respectively. Our net loss for the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was approximately $64.0 million, $33.6 million and $10.3 million, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $114.3
million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval for and begin commercialization of ZS-9. Accordingly, our ability to
continue to develop and commercialize ZS-9 and our other product candidates depends on our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or that such
financing, if available, will be available on favorable terms. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. </P>

biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials even after promising results in earlier nonclinical or clinical trials. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings made while clinical
trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Success in nonclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful,

that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of ZS-9. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of ZS-9 and would materially adversely

rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. We intend to seek regulatory approval of ZS-9 for the treatment of hyperkalemia. While current options for the chronic management of hyperkalemia are limited, we expect to
compete against well-known treatment options, including sodium polystyrene sulfonate, which is generically available. In addition, Relypsa is developing a hyperkalemia treatment, Patiromer, for which it has announced that it has completed its Phase
III development program and for which it has submitted an NDA to the FDA that the FDA has accepted. If approved by the FDA, this treatment will likely reach the U.S. market before ZS-9, potentially giving Relypsa an advantage over us in marketing
and gaining market acceptance. In order to compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate that the treatment of hyperkalemia with ZS-9 is a superior alternative to existing or new therapies for hyperkalemia, including Patiromer.
Even if we are able to demonstrate the superiority of our product, Relypsa or other competitors may attempt to lock us out of the market by entering into exclusive or preferred arrangements with insurers and other third party payors before our
product is approved for sale, which may make it difficult for us to successfully gain market penetration for ZS-9. In addition, our competitors may attempt to undercut our pricing for ZS-9 once it is introduced, or we may need to undercut the
pricing of Relypsa&#146;s drug to gain market acceptance, which could also harm our results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may face significant
competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are also researching and selling products designed to address these markets. Many of our potential competitors have materially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and
drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive expertise in nonclinical testing and clinical trials, in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs and in commercializing drugs following approval.
In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also
establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. Failure to effectively compete against established or future treatment options for hyperkalemia would harm our business, financial condition and results of
operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Clinical drug development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may
not be predictive of later trial results. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is
inherently uncertain. Furthermore, we rely on clinical trial sites and, in connection with some of our clinical trials outside the United States, contract research organizations, or CROs, to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical
trials and, while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of nonclinical studies and clinical
trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. For example, the positive results generated to date in clinical trials for ZS-9 do not ensure that our ongoing clinical trials will demonstrate
similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy, despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and earlier clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical
industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to inadequate efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks.
Even if our clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of
the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and physicians&#146; and patients&#146; perceptions as to the potential
advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are
being conducted, by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct
the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen
safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. For example, in February 2011, the
FDA issued a clinical hold, which remained in place for 11 months, on the basis that a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) had not been adequately established in our nonclinical studies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These
risks include the failure of enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory
schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we experience delays in the completion of any
clinical trial of ZS-9 or any future product candidates or such trials are terminated, the commercial prospects of ZS-9 or any future product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate revenues from any of these product candidates will be
delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, decelerate our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these
occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of
regulatory approval of our product candidates. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since our inception, most of our resources have been dedicated to the nonclinical and clinical development of our lead product candidate, ZS-9.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $114.3 million and capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $47.4 million and short-term investments of $54.9 million. In addition, we also had $10.0 million
available to us under the MidCap Credit Facility, as defined in the section entitled &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#148; We believe that we
will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future as we continue clinical development, seek regulatory approval, expand our manufacturing capability, prepare for the commercialization of ZS-9 and develop any other product
candidates we may choose to pursue. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, sales and marketing, conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials, seeking regulatory approvals, and developing our
manufacturing facility and supply arrangements. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any clinical trial and/or regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts
necessary to successfully complete the development, regulatory approval process and commercialization of ZS-9 or any future product candidates. </P>

allow us to fund our operating plan through at least December 31, 2015. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or
private equity, debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may affect our business. In
addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. </P>

other comparable foreign regulatory agencies, pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA or relevant foreign regulatory submission, to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug for ZS-9. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We must comply with cGMP regulations for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If we cannot successfully
manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for our manufacturing facilities. In
addition, we must maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel and our manufacturing equipment must meet certain qualifications. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve our facilities for
the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws its approval in the future, we may need to modify our manufacturing process or facilities or find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would be costly and could negatively impact
our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and market ZS-9, if approved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We continue to refine and improve the manufacturing
process for ZS-9, certain aspects of which are complex and unique, and we may encounter difficulties with new or existing processes, particularly as we seek to significantly increase our capacity to commercialize ZS-9. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, if our manufacturing facilities were to be damaged, destroyed or otherwise unable to operate, whether due to earthquakes, fire,
floods, hurricanes, storms, tornadoes, other natural disasters, employee malfeasance, terrorist acts, power outages or otherwise, or if performance of our manufacturing facility is disrupted for any other reason, such an event could delay our
clinical trials or, if ZS-9 or any future product candidates are approved, jeopardize our ability to manufacture our products as promptly as our customers expect or at all. If we are unable to manufacture a product candidate or approved product
within a timeframe that meets our clinical development needs or customers&#146; expectations, our business, prospects, results of operations and reputation could be materially harmed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We have limited experience manufacturing ZS-9 at our anticipated commercial scale. We will face certain risks associated with scaling up our
manufacturing capabilities to support anticipated commercial demand. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have developed two manufacturing facilities to manufacture
drug substance, which we use for research and development purposes and for clinical trials of ZS-9. We installed a 2,000 liter commercial scale reactor during the second quarter of 2014 and have successfully manufactured drug substances in this
reactor. We also received delivery of a second 2,000 liter commercial scale reactor in the fourth quarter of 2014. To meet our strategic objectives, which contemplate internally manufacturing all of our drug substance to support anticipated
commercial demand if ZS-9 is approved, we will need to install additional reactors, dryers and other equipment, add manufacturing personnel and ensure that validated processes are consistently implemented in our facilities. In particular, we
currently intend to eventually transition to 5,000 liter reactors for the commercial production of ZS-9. We have not yet attempted to use a 5,000 liter reactor to produce ZS-9 and there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully do so.

qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal

We cannot be certain if and when we will obtain formulary approval to allow us to sell ZS-9 or any future products into our target markets. Even if we do obtain formulary approval, third-party payors, such as government or private health care
insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan and other factors.
Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. Cost containment has been an increasing trend in the U.S. health care industry.
Large public and private payors, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such
third-party payors are questioning the coverage of, and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit coverage of, or reimbursement for, newly approved health care products. </P>

marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, or breach of warranty. Claims could also
be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease commercialization of ZS-9 or any future product

company on a timely basis, or at all. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with an increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, could also make it more difficult for us to attract and

Exchange Commission, or SEC, which generally require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Beginning with the second annual report that we
will be required to file with the SEC, Section&nbsp;404 requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to,
not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be
required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Obtaining this opinion will likely force us to incur significant expenses and consume
significant management resources. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)&nbsp;December 31, 2019, (2)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, (3)&nbsp;the

internal controls over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. In addition, as a public company we are
required to file accurate and timely quarterly and annual reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Any failure to report our results of operations on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from

or our partners must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies, that such drug candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. The
number of nonclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any
particular drug candidate. Results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for our drug candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to
support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering drug candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities
denying approval of a drug candidate for any or all targeted indications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory approval of an NDA or NDA supplement is not
guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the approval process and we may encounter matters with the FDA that require us to expend additional time and resources and delay

or trials, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program such as the number of patients in our current clinical trials from the United States. Further, there have been subject deaths in our clinical programs. While the incidence
of subject deaths is not unexpected in view of the morbidity and mortality for the patient populations in our trials and have been determined by the study investigators and by us as unrelated to ZS-9, the FDA may require us to perform additional
studies or otherwise delay regulatory approval of ZS-9. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the

us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which
could adversely affect our ability to market our products and adversely impact our results of operations. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the
regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Further, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. A person
or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal
anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses
and divert our management&#146;s attention from the operation of our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The PPACA also imposes new reporting and disclosure
requirements on drug manufacturers for any &#147;transfer of value&#148; made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. In addition, drug manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by
physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year
for &#147;knowing failures&#148;), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Manufacturers were required to begin data collection on August&nbsp;1, 2013 and to report such data to
the government by March&nbsp;31, 2014 and by the 90th calendar day of each year thereafter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, there has been a recent trend of
increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs and/or the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians. The
shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may
run afoul of one or more of the requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Healthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates&#146; commercial success.

final adjudication in several jurisdictions. In addition, Congress has also proposed a number of legislative initiatives, including possible repeal of the PPACA. At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to the PPACA,
whether to certain provisions or its entirety. We cannot assure you that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and results of operations and we cannot predict how future federal or state
legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have
been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals for spending reductions to Congress. The Joint
Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, which triggered the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs, including aggregate reductions to
Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated
by the sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The ATRA, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover
overpayments to providers from three to five years. In March 2013, the President signed an executive order implementing sequestration, and in April&nbsp;2013, the 2% Medicare reductions went into effect. We cannot predict whether any additional
legislative changes will affect our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and
state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is a significant amount of intellectual property litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and we may become a party
to, or threatened with litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technology or product candidates. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future
intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that ZS-9 or any future product candidates will not infringe existing or future third-party patents. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or
more after filing, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware and which may later result in issued patents that we may infringe by commercializing ZS-9 or future product candidates. Moreover, we may face claims from non-practicing
entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. In addition, ZS-9 has a complex structure that makes it difficult to conduct a thorough search and review of all potentially
relevant third-party patents that may impact our freedom to operate. We may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of ZS-9 or our other product candidates. There also may be prior art of
which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of our owned or licensed patents or patent applications, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of such patents or
patent applications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2013, one of our competitors, Relypsa, filed a patent application with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office, or USPTO, seeking broad claims directed to removing potassium from a patient. Prosecution of this patent application is ongoing and we expect the next office action from the USPTO to occur in the third quarter of 2015, although it
could happen earlier. Such action could include a Notice of Allowance, a Non-Final Rejection or a Final Rejection. If a patent were to issue with the currently pending or similarly broad claims pursuant to a Notice of Allowance, it would potentially
cover the use of ZS-9 in the treatment of hyperkalemia. We believe that such a patent should not issue, and if it does, it should be found to be invalid and unenforceable. Nevertheless, challenging this patent would be costly and time consuming, and
if such challenge were unsuccessful, it could materially impact or prevent the commercialization of ZS-9 for the treatment of hyperkalemia, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
the event that a patent with the current or similarly broad claims is issued, we intend to vigorously challenge it, although there is no assurance that a court would find any challenged claims to be invalid. </P>

nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property, and we may be required to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or forced to
redesign it, or to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our partners are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. Even if we are successful in defending

proceedings in the European Patent Office or corresponding offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. Since patent applications are confidential for a period of time after

intellectual property rights. Even where laws provide protection, to counter such infringement or other violations, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and the outcome
of such litigation would be uncertain. If we or one of our present or future partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering ZS-9 or one of our future products or product candidates, the defendant could
counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, counterclaims by defendants alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged
failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant
information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution of the relevant patent. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to validity, for example, we cannot be
certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held
unenforceable or interpreted narrowly, and could put any of our patent applications at risk of not yielding an issued patent. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability against our intellectual property
related to ZS-9, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on ZS-9. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, in an infringement proceeding a court may refuse to
prevent the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. Moreover, our competitors or other third parties could counterclaim that we infringe their intellectual property, and
some of our competitors have substantially greater intellectual property portfolios than we do. In any intellectual property litigation, even if we are successful, any award of monetary damages or other remedy that we may receive may not be
commercially valuable. In addition, due to the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during such
litigation. </P>

other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions patent applications related to our novel technologies
and product candidates that are important to our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not
be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too
late to obtain patent protection. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing or prosecution of patent applications,
or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. In some circumstances, our licensors may have the right to enforce the licensed patents without our involvement or consent, or to decide not to enforce or to allow
us to enforce the licensed patents. Therefore, these patents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. For example, pursuant to our license agreement with UOP, UOP has
retained responsibility for prosecuting and maintaining the patent rights they have licensed to us and has the first right to enforce the licensed patent rights against third-party infringement. If any of our licensors fail to maintain such patents,
or lose rights to those patents, the rights that we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated and our right to develop and commercialize any of our product candidates that are the subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the laws of foreign jurisdictions may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example,
European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the
United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or
licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Moreover, the USPTO might require that the term of a patent issuing from a pending patent application be
disclaimed and limited to the term of another patent that is commonly owned or names a common inventor. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, term, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in
part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In particular, during prosecution of any patent application, the issuance of any patents based on the application may depend upon our ability to
generate additional nonclinical or clinical data that support the patentability of our proposed claims. We may not be able to generate sufficient additional data on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or
interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the
enforcement or defense of issued patents that we own or license. On September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United
States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation and switch the United States patent system from a &#147;first-to-invent&#148; system to a
&#147;first-to-file&#148; system. Under a first-to-file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether
another inventor had made the invention </P>

earlier. The USPTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the
Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first-to-file provisions, only became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the
Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned and licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents that we own or license, all of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance
submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, <I>inter partes</I> review, post-grant review or interference proceedings or other patent office proceedings or litigation, in the United States or
elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission or proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights; allow third parties to commercialize our technology
or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us; or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our
owned and licensed patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. </P>

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patentability of inventions, and the validity, enforcement and scope of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field
involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Consequently, the patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries for many reasons. For example, there
is no assurance that we were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications in respect of the inventions claimed in our patent applications. Even if patents have issued or do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the
validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For example, patents granted by the European Patent Office may be opposed by any person within nine months from the
publication of the grant. Similar proceedings are available in other jurisdictions, and in some jurisdictions third parties can raise questions of validity with a patent office even before a patent has granted. Furthermore, even if they are
unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. For example, a third-party may develop a competitive product that provides therapeutic
benefits similar to ZS-9 but has a sufficiently different composition to fall outside the scope of our patent protection. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold, license or pursue with
respect to ZS-9 or any future product candidates is successfully challenged, it could negatively affect our ability to commercialize ZS-9 or any future product candidates. As a result, we may also face unexpected competition that could have a
material adverse impact on our business. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market ZS-9 or any future product candidates under patent protection, if approved, would be reduced. The scope
of our owned and licensed intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to prevent others from manufacturing or selling competing products. For example, our intellectual property position depends in part on patent rights that we have licensed
from UOP. Certain of these licensed patents, including patents with composition-of-matter claims covering ZS-9 are expected to expire by 2017. Such expiration date is only shortly after the date by which we expect ZS-9 to be commercialized in the
United States, assuming we obtain marketing approval, and may even be prior to such date. We have also licensed rights to a United States patent claiming a method of using ZS-9 to remove toxins from a fluid, including in the treatment of
hyperkalemia, from UOP that is currently expected to expire in 2019, without taking into account any potential patent term extension that may be available to us under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the
Hatch-Waxman Act. As a result, we may not be able to prevent competitors from commercializing products similar or identical to ZS-9 after these licensed patents expire. </P>

particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming and inherently
uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted the Leahy-Smith Act and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either
narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this
combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained. Depending on future actions by the United States Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change
in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. </P>

USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties can oppose pending trademark applications and seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our
trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we fail to secure trademark registration for ZS-9 and our future product candidates, our ability to market such product offerings and our business could be adversely affected. Moreover, any name we
propose to use with our product candidates in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names,
including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable
substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. The EMA will conduct a similar review process of the names we propose to use with our product

in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other forms of intellectual
property protection, especially those relating to biopharmaceuticals. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries

of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business, which could seriously harm our financial

business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of

executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our
common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)&nbsp;December 31, 2019, (2)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, (3)&nbsp;the date on which we are deemed to be

approximately $93.7 million and federal research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $5.2 million, net of limitations pursuant to Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, discussed below. These NOL
carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards, if not previously used, will begin to expire in 2029. The future utilization of our NOL carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards will be subject to certain annual limitations, pursuant
to Section&nbsp;382 of the Code, as a result of several ownership changes since the Company was founded in 2008, with the most recent Section&nbsp;382 change of ownership occurring on June&nbsp;23, 2014. We estimate the ownership changes will result
in $1.5 million of net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused and $0.1 million of federal research tax credit carryforwards expiring unused. Moreover, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our
stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income in the future, the limitations on our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards to reduce U.S. federal tax liability could potentially result in higher
future tax liability to us compared to what we would have incurred had we been able to fully take advantage of these assets. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;17, 2014, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-195961) relating to the IPO of our common stock was declared
effective by the SEC. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC acted as joint book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters in the offering. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The shares began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on June&nbsp;18, 2014. The sale of the shares in our IPO closed on June&nbsp;23,
2014 and we sold 6,836,111 shares of common stock, which included 891,667 shares of common stock issued pursuant to the option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters. The total proceeds of our IPO, based on the public offering
price of $18.00 per share, were approximately $123.0 million. There were no purchases of our securities by us or any &#147;affiliated purchaser&#148; as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) of the Exchange Act. We received net proceeds from the offering of
$114.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $8.6 million. After deducting offering expenses of approximately $2.3 million, remaining proceeds were $112.1 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all shares of convertible
preferred stock then outstanding converted into 11,979,479 shares of common stock. No underwriting discounts or expenses resulted in direct or indirect payments to any of our directors, officers or their associates, to persons owning 10% or more of
our common stock or to any of our affiliates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The net proceeds from our IPO have been used and will be used, together with our cash, cash
equivalents and short- term investments, to fund continued advancement of our Phase III ZS004e clinical trial, long-term safety trial ZS005, manufacturing scale-up activities and pre-clinical programs, with the balance to be used to fund working
capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, which may include in-licenses, acquiring, or investing in additional businesses, technologies, products, or assets the acquisition or licensing of other products, businesses or

company focused on the development and commercialization of highly selective, non-absorbed drugs to treat renal, cardiovascular, liver and metabolic diseases. Our proprietary zirconium silicate technology allows us to create highly selective ion
traps that can reduce toxic levels of specific electrolytes without disturbing the balance of other electrolytes. Our initial focus is on the development of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS-9), our product candidate for which we recently completed
two Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of hyperkalemia, a life-threatening condition in which elevated levels of potassium in the blood (greater than 5.0 mEq/L) increase the risk of muscle dysfunction, including cardiac arrhythmias and
sudden cardiac death. We have designed our development program based on input from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, including a recent pre-NDA meeting, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and plan to submit our New Drug
Application, or NDA, in the United States in the second quarter of 2015 and our Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in Europe in the second half of 2015 with the goal of obtaining approval for the treatment of acute and chronic
hyperkalemia, regardless of the underlying disease state. If we receive regulatory approval, we intend to commercialize ZS-9 for the treatment of hyperkalemia in the United States with our own specialty sales force targeting nephrologists and
cardiologists and intend to seek one or more partners for commercialization in markets outside of the United States. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of March&nbsp;1,
2015, we have enrolled over 1,474 patients in our clinical studies. In our ongoing long-term studies, patients have safely received once daily ZS-9 for over 10 months. We have completed three, double-blind, randomized placebo controlled clinical
studies with ZS-9 that together enrolled 1,101 patients with hyperkalemia, including patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes and those on renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor therapy. Our
first in-man study, ZS002, was completed in May 2012 and our first Phase III study, ZS003, was completed in November 2013. Our second Phase III study, ZS004, was completed in September 2014. All three trials met their pre-specified primary efficacy
endpoints with clinically meaningful and statistically significant results. We announced the top-line results for ZS004 in September 2014 and presented detailed primary and secondary endpoint results for ZS004 at the American Heart Association
Scientific Sessions on November&nbsp;17, 2014. The ZS004 study results were simultaneously published in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>, and we announced the publication of detailed results from the ZS003 study in the <I>New
England Journal of Medicine</I> on November&nbsp;21, 2014. We initiated an extension to the ZS004 study, or ZS004e, and a long-term safety study, ZS005, in the second quarter of 2014. We expect to file our NDA with the FDA in the second quarter of
2015 and our MAA with the EMA in the second half of 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ZS-9 was developed utilizing proprietary zirconium silicate technology, the
rights to which we currently have pursuant to a 2011 license agreement with UOP, which grants us an exclusive license under specified patent rights held by UOP to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products for use in the field of removing
toxins from bodily fluids and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans and animals, which includes ZS-9 and any other product covered by the terms of the license agreement. Under the terms of the license agreement, we will owe UOP royalties equal
to 5% of worldwide net sales of ZS-9 made by us or our sublicensees, and we are obligated to make a minimum annual royalty payment to UOP, which commenced with payments of $25,000 and $50,000 in 2010 and 2011, respectively, increasing to $100,000
for 2012 and years thereafter. </P>

$114.3 million. We incurred net losses of approximately $64.0 million, $33.6 million and $10.3 million in the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We expect to continue to incur net losses as we advance ZS-9
through clinical development, seek regulatory approval, expand our manufacturing capabilities and prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization. We manufacture clinical trial quantities of ZS-9 in-house in two facilities from readily
available starting materials using specialized equipment. We are currently in the process of increasing our manufacturing capabilities to support anticipated commercial demand. Additionally, we have established a supply chain to provide us with the
materials required to manufacture ZS-9. We expect to significantly increase our investment in our commercial manufacturing process and inventory of ZS-9, and in our commercialization and marketing related activities as we prepare for a possible
commercial launch of ZS-9. We do not have a sales organization, and we will need substantial additional funding to support our operating activities. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to obtain
sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Financial Overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;23,
2014, we completed our IPO of 6,836,111 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of $112.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial
resources to identify, acquire, and develop our product candidates, and in particular ZS-9, including conducting clinical studies and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have funded our operations primarily
from the sale of convertible preferred stock and equity securities and a small amount of secured debt. We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $64.0 million, $33.6 million and
$10.3 million for the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 we had an accumulated deficit of $114.3 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with
our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Revenue </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, we have not generated any revenues. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur before 2016, at the
earliest, will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and EMA for, and, subsequent to that, our successful commercialization of ZS-9. If we fail to complete the development of ZS-9 in a timely manner or to obtain regulatory
approval, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely effected. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expense both internal and external research and development costs in the periods in which they
are incurred. To date, we have focused substantially all of our resources and development efforts on the development of ZS-9 and we incurred research and development costs of $45.6 million, $24.8 million and $7.0 million in the years 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect our research and development expenses to increase during the next few years as we seek to complete our
clinical program, pursue regulatory approval of ZS-9 in the United States and internationally and prepare for a possible commercial launch of ZS-9, which, if approved, will require significant investment to increase our manufacturing capabilities to
support anticipated commercial demand. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to increased size and greater duration of the related clinical
trials, which we expect to be the case for our ZS004e and ZS005 clinical trials. Predicting the timing or the final cost to complete our clinical program and/or validation of our commercial manufacturing and supply processes is difficult and delays
or unexpected costs may occur because of many factors, including factors outside of our control. Furthermore, we are unable to predict when or if ZS-9 will receive regulatory approval in the United States or in any other countries with any
certainty. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>General and Administrative Expenses </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation
expense, associated with our executive, finance, business and corporate development and other administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include allocated depreciation and facility-related costs, legal costs of pursuing
patent protection of our intellectual property and professional fees for consulting, auditing, tax and legal services. We incurred general and administrative expenses of $14.9 million, $7.4 million and $1.1 million in the years 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase as we expand our operating activities and increase our

consisted of the fair value of shares issued for interest earned on convertible notes during the period the notes were outstanding, the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible notes over the period the notes were
outstanding, the amortization of the fair value of warrants that were issued in connection with our borrowings, with the initial fair value of the warrants being amortized to interest expense over the term of the governing agreements, and since
November 2012 consists of the amortization of debt issuance costs, primarily legal and banker fees, and debt discount in connection with the notes issued under the MidCap Credit Facility (as defined in &#147;&#151;Liquidity and Capital

manufacturing activities. <I> </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>General and Administrative</I>.&nbsp;General and administrative expenses increased $6.3 million, or

ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 from $62,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012. The increase was due to the increased value of warrants to acquire Series B preferred stock as we approached our IPO.<I> </I></P>

our significant research and development expenditures, we have generated significant operating losses since our inception. We have funded our operations primarily through our IPO, sales of our preferred shares of stock and a small amount of secured

short-term investments are currently held in a variety of interest and non-interest bearing accounts at financial institutions and invested in a variety of short-term interest-bearing instruments. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested
with a view toward liquidity and capital preservation, and we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2014, we entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (Credit Agreement) with MidCap
Financial SBIC, LP (MidCap) for a $20 million credit facility, secured by all of our assets, with a negative pledge against our intellectual property (with all amendments thereto, the MidCap Credit Facility). The MidCap Credit Facility is structured
in two $10 million tranches, with the first tranche previously drawn at closing and the second tranche to be drawn after we provide evidence to MidCap of positive primary endpoint results from our ZS004 clinical study, which has occurred, but before
its expiration on October&nbsp;31, 2014. In September 2014, we entered into the First Amendment to Credit and Security Agreement, which extended the second tranche commitment termination date from October&nbsp;31, 2014 to March&nbsp;31, 2015. Notes
issued under the terms of the Credit Agreement bear interest at the rate of 7.5%&nbsp;per annum, payable monthly, have principal payable in 36 monthly installments commencing on January&nbsp;1, 2016 and are subject to a $50,000 fee which we paid to
MidCap upon closing. On January&nbsp;1, 2019, the maturity date of the notes, we will owe MidCap an exit fee equal to 6.5% of the amount of notes funded under the Credit Agreement. We issued a note payable to MidCap in the amount of $10 million for
the first tranche on July&nbsp;14, 2014. The 6.5% exit fee is being recognized as additional interest expense over the term of the note. Also in September 2014, MidCap assigned $2.5 million of the credit facility to Silicon Valley Bank. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;23, 2014, we closed our IPO of 6,836,111 shares of our common stock, which included 891,667 shares of common stock issued
pursuant to the option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters. The public offering price of the shares sold in the offering was $18.00 per share. The total proceeds from the offering to us, net of underwriting discounts and
commissions of approximately $8.6 million, were approximately $114.4 million. After deducting offering expenses payable by us of approximately $2.3 million, our net proceeds were approximately $112.1 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, 11,979,479
shares of Preferred Stock and Redeemable Preferred Stock then outstanding automatically converted into 11,979,479 shares of our common stock. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the
foreseeable future. We expect our cash expenditures to increase in the near term as we work to complete our clinical program for ZS-9, pursue regulatory approval in the United States and prepare for a possible commercial launch of ZS-9. In
particular, our pre-commercialization activities for ZS-9, including development costs relating to the expansion and validation of our commercial manufacturing process and inventory supply and the hiring and training of a sales force, will require
significant investment in our manufacturing facilities, personnel and other commercial launch related costs. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and available borrowings under our MidCap Credit Facility will
allow us to fund our operating plan through at least December&nbsp;31, 2015. However, we anticipate that we may need to raise additional financing in the future. In order to meet these additional cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional
equity or convertible debt securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders or enter into additional debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could have
rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve arrangements that include covenants limiting or
restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us, if
at all. Our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. </P>

financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from
period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from management&#146;s estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. While our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to our financial statements, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to
understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management&#146;s judgments and estimates. </P>

trial costs are a component of research and development expenses. We accrue and expense clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon actual patient enrollment in accordance with agreements established with third-party vendors and
clinical sites. We determine the actual expense accrual through review of patient enrollment databases and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for each patient enrolled less any payments made. During the course of a clinical trial, we may adjust our rate
of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Although
we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us
reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. Our clinical trial accrual is dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from clinical sites and other third-party vendors. Through
December&nbsp;31, 2014, there have been no material adjustments to our prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Stock-Based

of stock option awards. The fair value is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award on a straight-line basis. Vesting terms for certain
employee grant agreements did not initially match the terms approved by our board of directors. Accordingly, these options were not considered granted for accounting purposes until a mutual understanding of the terms was obtained through amendment
of the grant agreements in January 2014. Certain of these options were considered to have service inception dates in 2013, which resulted in the vested portion of these options being re-measured to fair value throughout 2013. </P>

research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $5.2 million, net of limitations pursuant to Section&nbsp;382 of the Code discussed below. These NOL carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards, if not previously used, will begin to expire
in 2029. The future utilization of our NOL carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards will be subject to an annual limitation, pursuant to Section&nbsp;382 of the Code, as a result of several ownership changes since the Company was founded
in 2008, with the most recent Section 382 change of ownership occurring on June 23, 2014. We estimate the ownership changes will result in $1.5 million of net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused and $0.1 million of federal research tax
credit carryforwards expiring unused. Moreover, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shift in stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income in the future, the limitations on our ability to use our
NOL carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards to reduce U.S. federal tax liability could potentially result in higher future tax liability to us compared to what we would have incurred had we been able to fully take advantage of these

investment policy provides for investments in low-risk, investment-grade debt instruments. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $102.3 million consisting of bank deposits, investments in
short-term interest-bearing instruments and investments in short-term marketable securities. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We face foreign exchange risk as a result of entering into transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In particular, we
pay our research sites outside of the United States in the currencies of their respective jurisdictions. Due to the uncertain timing of expected payments in foreign currencies, we do not utilize any forward exchange contracts. All foreign
transactions settle on the applicable spot exchange basis at the time such payments are made. An adverse movement in foreign exchange rates could have a material effect on payments made to foreign suppliers and for license agreements. A hypothetical
10% change in foreign exchange rates or interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the control
system are met. The design of a control system reflects resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

assessing strategic risk exposure and our audit committee is responsible for overseeing our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures. The audit committee also monitors compliance
with legal and regulatory requirements. Our nominating and governance committee monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines and considers and approves or disapproves any related-persons transactions. Our compensation committee

additional requirements regarding the payment of deferred compensation. Generally, if at any time during a taxable year a nonqualified deferred compensation plan fails to meet the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, or is not operated in
accordance with those requirements, all amounts deferred under the 2014 Plan and all other equity incentive plans for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years by any participant with respect to whom the failure relates are includible in
gross income for the taxable year to the extent not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not previously included in gross income. If a deferred amount is required to be included in income under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, the amount
also is subject to interest and an additional income tax. The interest imposed is equal to the interest at the underpayment rate plus one percentage point, imposed on the underpayments that would have occurred had the compensation been includible in
income for the taxable year when first deferred, or if later, when not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The additional U.S. federal income tax is equal to 20% of the compensation required to be included in gross income. In addition,
certain states, including California, have laws similar to Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, which impose additional state penalty taxes on such compensation. </TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

of the corporation. However, under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, the deduction limit does not apply to certain &#147;performance-based compensation&#148; established by an independent compensation committee that is adequately disclosed to and
approved by stockholders. In particular, stock options and SARs will satisfy the &#147;performance-based compensation&#148; exception if the awards are made by a qualifying compensation committee, the 2014 Plan sets the maximum number of shares that
can be granted to any person within a specified period and the compensation is based solely on an increase in the stock price after the grant date. Specifically, the option exercise price must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the
stock subject to the award on the grant date. Under a Code Section&nbsp;162(m) transition rule for compensation plans of corporations which are privately held and which become publicly held in an initial public offering, the 2014 Plan will not be

and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>

and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Description of Organization </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ZS Pharma, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of highly selective, non-absorbed drugs to
treat renal, cardiovascular, liver and metabolic diseases. Our proprietary zirconium silicate technology allows us to create highly selective ion traps that can reduce toxic levels of specific electrolytes without disturbing the balance of other
electrolytes. Our lead product candidate, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, (or ZS-9), recently completed Phase III development for the treatment of hyperkalemia, a life-threatening condition in which elevated levels of potassium increase the risk of
muscle dysfunction, including cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We expect to file a New Drug Application (NDA) for ZS-9 for the treatment of hyperkalemia within the first half of 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;17, 2014, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-195961) relating to our initial public offering (IPO) of our
common stock was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our shares began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on June&nbsp;18, 2014. The public offering price of the shares sold in the offering was $18.00 per
share. The IPO closed on June&nbsp;23, 2014 and included 6,836,111 shares of common stock, which included 891,667 shares of common stock issued pursuant to the option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares. We received total
proceeds from the offering to us, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $8.6 million, of approximately $114.4 million. After deducting offering expenses of approximately $2.3 million, net proceeds were approximately $112.1 million. Upon
the closing of the IPO, all shares of convertible preferred stock then outstanding converted into 11,979,479 shares of common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon
the effectiveness of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company on June&nbsp;23, 2014, the number of shares of capital stock the Company is authorized to issue was increased to 255,000,000 shares, of which 250,000,000
shares are common stock and 5,000,000 shares are preferred stock. Both the common stock and preferred stock have a par value of $0.001 per share. There were no shares of preferred stock outstanding at September&nbsp;30, 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Basis of Presentation Including Liquidity </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which
contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has financed its operations from inception primarily through sales of common and preferred stock, and financing under debt arrangements. The future success of the Company is
dependent on its ability to develop its product candidate and ultimately upon its ability to attain profitable operations. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life science companies, including, but not limited to, successful
discovery and development of its drug candidates, raising additional capital, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, and market acceptance of the Company&#146;s products. As a result of
the aforementioned factors and the related uncertainties, there can be no assurance of the Company&#146;s future success. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $114.3&nbsp;million and may require substantial
additional capital for research, product development and commercialization of ZS-9. The Company believes its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December&nbsp;31, 2014, totaling $102.3 million as well as its ability to draw $10
million on its MidCap Credit Facility (see Note 6) are sufficient to fund operations for a period of at least 12 months from the balance sheet date based on projected 2015 cash needs. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.<B> </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2014, our board of directors and our stockholders approved an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to
effect a reverse split of shares of our common stock on a 1-for-2.56437 basis (the Reverse Stock Split). The par values and the authorized shares of the common and convertible preferred stock were not adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.
All issued and outstanding common stock, convertible preferred stock, options for common stock, warrants for common and preferred stock, and per share amounts contained in the financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this
Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. The Reverse Stock Split was made effective on June&nbsp;11, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
Investments </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Our
marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate the designations at each balance sheet date. We
invest in highly-rated securities, and our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer, industry group and currency. The policy requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the
potential risk of principal loss and providing liquidity of investments sufficient to meet our operating and capital spending requirements and debt repayments. No security in our portfolio shall have a maturity date greater than 12 months at the
time of purchase. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We classify our marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument&#146;s underlying
contractual maturity date and as to whether and when we intend to sell a particular security prior to its maturity date. Marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the date of purchase and 12 months or less remaining at the
balance sheet date will be classified as short-term. Our marketable securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders&#146;
equity. Fair values are determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Realized gains and losses on the sale of
securities are determined by specific identification of each security&#146;s cost basis. We may sell certain of our marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit
deterioration and liquidity and duration management. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We continually review our available for sale securities to determine whether a
decline in fair value below the carrying value is other than temporary. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, we review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the
financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment&#146;s cost basis. Once a decline in fair value is
determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If we do not intend to sell the debt security, but it is probable that we will not collect all amounts due, then only the
impairment due to the credit risk would be recognized in earnings and the remaining amount of the impairment would be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders&#146; equity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company places its cash with institutions with high credit quality. However, at certain times such cash may be in excess of Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation and Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Restricted Cash </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;22, 2013, the Company executed an agreement to pledge, assign, transfer, and grant a security interest to J.P. Morgan Bank to secure the
payment and performance of the Company&#146;s credit card program. The Company agreed to maintain $150,000 in a restricted cash account, given it is a pre-revenue company. In August 2014, the credit limit of the program was increased from $150,000
to $300,000 and at that time we increased the balance in the restricted cash account by $150,000. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their
carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. There have been no impairment charges related to long-lived
assets from inception through December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Licenses and Patents </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Licenses and patent costs are expensed as incurred. Licenses are classified as research and development expenses, and patents are classified as general and
administrative expenses in the statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Research and Development Expenses </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses represent costs associated with the ongoing development of ZS-9,
the Company&#146;s lead development compound, and include salaries, supplies, stock compensation and expenses for clinical trials and preclinical research. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Redeemable Preferred Stock Warrant Liability </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Freestanding warrants for shares that are either puttable or redeemable are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet and are carried at their estimated
fair value. As further discussed in Note&nbsp;7, the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, which was able to be purchased with the warrants, was redeemable at a future date in 2017. As such, these warrants were classified as liabilities and at the
end of each reporting period, changes in the estimated fair value during the period were recorded in other income (expense). Prior to June&nbsp;17, 2014, the warrants were all exercised into Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, which was converted
into Common Stock upon the IPO, and the amount of warrant liability was reclassified to shareholders&#146; equity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Fair Value Measurements </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ASC 820, <I>Fair Value Measurement</I>, provides a comprehensive framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities, which provides for

measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors to be recognized in the financial statements, based on their fair value. The value of awards ultimately expected to vest is

Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations was $7.7 million and $2.1 million for the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These amounts include $0.2 million of share-based compensation

the asset and liability approach in accordance with the provision of ASC 740, <I>Income Taxes</I>. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. Valuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company continues to record a valuation allowance for the full
amount of deferred tax assets, which would otherwise be recorded for tax benefits relating to the operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as realization of such deferred tax assets cannot be determined to be more likely than not. </P>

positions and no interest or penalties have been charged to the Company from inception through December&nbsp;31, 2014. If incurred, the Company will classify any interest and penalties as a component of tax expense. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have determined that we have had several changes of ownership, as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;382 (Section&nbsp;382), since the
company was founded in 2008, with the most recent Section&nbsp;382 change of ownership occurring on June&nbsp;23, 2014. According to the provisions of Section&nbsp;382, our net operating losses and research credits will be subject to certain annual
limitations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had federal income tax net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $93.7 million and federal research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $5.2 million, net of limitations pursuant to
Section&nbsp;382 of the Code. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Use of Estimates </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of its Common Stock. Management determined the estimated fair value of the Company&#146;s Common Stock based on a number of objective and subjective factors, including external
market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector and the prices at which the Company sold shares of convertible preferred stock; the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to the Company&#146;s Common Stock at the time;
and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO or sale of the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company engaged third-party valuation specialists to assist
in estimating the fair value of its Common Stock and in performing valuation analyses as of the grant or other valuation dates in 2013 and prior periods. The valuation specialists utilized various valuation methodologies in accordance with the
framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, <I>Audit and Accounting Practice Aid Series: Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation</I>, or the AICPA Practice Aid. The
methodologies included the Option Pricing Method utilizing the Backsolve Method (a form of the market approach defined in the AICPA Practice Aid) and the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method based upon the probability of occurrence of certain
future liquidity events such as an initial public offering or sale of the Company. Each valuation methodology included estimates and assumptions that required the Company&#146;s judgment. Significant changes to the key assumptions used in the
valuations could result in different fair values of Common Stock at each valuation date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Reclassifications </B></P>

expenses in the consolidated statements of income to conform to the current year&#146;s presentation. Medical Affairs is a subset of clinical development focused on interfacing with key physician researchers to help refine clinical trial design,
review and analyze results of our clinical trials, and work with key clinical investigators to help them disseminate trial results to other physicians and patients through publications and presentations. The amount of Medical Affairs expenses
reclassified for 2013 and 2012 were $254,000 and $0, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During 2014, the Company determined that the holding period for restricted cash used
to secure the payment and performance of the Company&#146;s credit card program would be longer than 12 months. Accordingly, the Company reclassified restricted cash on its balance sheet from current assets to non-current assets. The amount of
restricted cash reclassified for 2013 was $150,000. </P>

number of common shares outstanding during the period without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share of common stock is the same as basic net loss per share of common stock, since the effects of potentially dilutive
securities are antidilutive. The net loss per share of common stock attributable to common shareholders was computed using the two-class method required for participating securities. All series of our convertible preferred stock were considered to
be participating securities as they were entitled to participate in undistributed earnings with shares of common stock. Due to our net loss, there was no impact on the earnings per share calculation in applying the two-class method since the
participating securities had no legal requirement to share in any losses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, <I>Revenue from Contracts with Customers</I>. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after
December&nbsp;15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The revenue standard&#146;s core principle is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services. It attempts to depict the exchange
of rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to which the vendor is entitled. To accomplish this objective, the standard requires five basic steps: (1)&nbsp;identify the contract with
the customer, (2)&nbsp;identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3)&nbsp;determine the transaction price, (4)&nbsp;allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, (5)&nbsp;recognize revenue when (or as)
the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Management is currently evaluating the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-12, <I>Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved
after the Requisite Service Period.</I> The amendments in this update require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity
should apply existing guidance in ASC 718, Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation, as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The amendments in this update will be effective for the Company as
of January&nbsp;1, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this update either: (1)&nbsp;prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (2)&nbsp;retrospectively to all awards with
performance </P>

targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If a retrospective transition is
adopted, the cumulative effect of applying this update as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance at that date. In addition,
if a retrospective transition is adopted, an entity may use hindsight in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. Management is currently assessing the impact of this update, and believes that its adoption on January&nbsp;1, 2016 will not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-15, <I>Presentation of Financial
Statements&#151;Going Concern</I>. The amendments in this update require management to assess an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing
standards. Specifically, the amendments (1)&nbsp;provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2)&nbsp;require an evaluation every reporting period, including interim periods, (3)&nbsp;provide principles for considering the mitigating effect
of management&#146;s plans, (4)&nbsp;require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#146;s plans, (5)&nbsp;require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not
alleviated, and (6)&nbsp;require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update are effective for us as of January&nbsp;1, 2017. Early
application is permitted. Management is currently assessing the impact of this update. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>2. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments </B></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Total rent expense charged to operations under terms of these operating leases was $0.5 million and $0.2 million
for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>6. Borrowings </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Convertible Notes </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November&nbsp;2011, the Company
issued a $3.0 million mandatorily convertible note payable to Devon Park Bioventures, L.P. (Devon Park), with $2.5 million received at closing and $0.5 million received in December&nbsp;2011. At the same time, the Company issued identical notes
payable to 18 other investors and received an additional $1.3 million. One investor immediately converted its $175,000 note into 47,064 shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock. In July&nbsp;2012, the Company issued an additional identical $1.0
million note payable to Devon Park. The notes were payable at the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the sale of the Company or (ii)&nbsp;the liquidation of the Company and bore interest at the rate of 8.0% simple interest per annum, to be accrued but not payable
unless and until the principal was repaid. The notes also included a requirement for mandatory conversion, upon the closing of a future equity financing of at least $15.0 million from new investors, into either Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock or
the new equity security issued in the financing transaction. Upon the conversion of the notes, the noteholders were entitled to receive warrants exercisable for shares of the same security into which the notes were converted, at an amount equal to
25% of the shares received upon conversion. In October&nbsp;2012, the Company consummated its Series C redeemable preferred equity offering, which triggered the mandatory conversion of the notes payable. The notes, plus accrued interest of $0.3
million, were converted into 1,463,937 shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock. At the same time, the Company issued warrants exercisable for 365,986 shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The contingent repayment feature of the notes was determined to be an embedded derivative to be accounted for separately from the notes payable and
subsequently marked to market. Given the unlikelihood of the events requiring repayment, the value of the repayment feature was determined to be inconsequential. The right to receive the warrants was accounted for as warrants issued at the date the
notes were issued. The fair value of these warrants was recorded separately from the value of the notes, and the warrants are classified as a liability and are being marked to market each period (see Note&nbsp;7). The warrants to be received by the
note holders upon conversion of the notes into preferred stock resulted in a beneficial conversion feature associated with the notes payable of $1.0 million on the notes issued in November&nbsp;2011 and $0.3 million on the additional note issued in
2012. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the convertible note transactions, the Company received gross proceeds of $5.3 million, which were offset by issuance costs for
legal and banking services of $0.5 million. Warrants were also issued to bankers totaling $0.1 million for services provided relating to the convertible note transactions, which were recorded as deferred debt issuance costs, similar to the other
legal and banking services paid for in cash. These costs were amortized over the period the notes were outstanding. The fair value of the warrants issued to the noteholders of $1.1 million and the beneficial conversion feature relating to the notes,
including accrued interest, of $1.3 million were recorded as discounts to the notes and accreted through interest expense in 2011 and 2012. Amortization of the deferred financing costs and accretion of the discount on the notes to the date the notes
were converted, including the effect of the beneficial conversion feature noted above, resulted in a charge recognized in interest expense of $1.8 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 ($0 for each of the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2014 and 2013). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Credit Facility </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2014, we
entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (Credit Agreement) with MidCap Financial SBIC, LP (MidCap) for a $20 million credit facility, secured by all of our assets, with a negative pledge against our intellectual property. The credit facility is
structured in two $10 million tranches, with the first tranche drawn at closing and the second tranche to be drawn after we provide evidence to MidCap of positive primary endpoint results from our ZS004 clinical study, which has occurred, but before

January&nbsp;1, 2016 and are subject to a $50,000 fee payable to MidCap upon closing. On January&nbsp;1, 2019, the maturity date of the notes, we will owe MidCap an exit fee equal to 6.5% of the amount of notes funded under the Credit Agreement. We
issued a note payable to MidCap in the amount of $10 million for the first tranche on July&nbsp;14, 2014. The 6.5% exit fee is being recognized as additional interest expense over the term of the note. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2014, we entered into the First Amendment to Credit and Security Agreement, which extended the second tranche commitment termination date from
October&nbsp;31, 2014 to March&nbsp;31, 2015. Also in September 2014, MidCap assigned $2.5 million of the credit facility to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The estimated fair value of the MidCap debt is $10.1 million. The fair value was estimated based upon management&#146;s use of an income approach utilizing a

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The valuation of the share-based compensation awards is a significant accounting estimate that requires the use
of judgment and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on the financial statements. The fair value of option grants is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatilities utilized in the model are based on
implied volatilities from traded stocks of peer companies. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and the estimate of future dividend yields. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant. The expected lives of the grants are based on the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. As the Company does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations
about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior, the expected term is calculated as the midpoint between the weighted-average vesting term and the contractual expiration periods also known as the simplified method.
The Company assumed no awards would be forfeited during the vesting period, as actual forfeitures have been minimal through December&nbsp;31, 2014, and the remaining weighted-average vesting term for nonvested options is for a relatively brief time
(less than two years). The fair value of the option grants have been estimated, with the following weighted-average assumptions: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

terms for certain employee grant agreements did not initially match the terms approved by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors for 2,017,650 of the options reflected as granted in 2012 and 2013 in the tables above. Accordingly, these options were
not considered granted for accounting purposes until a mutual understanding of the terms was obtained through amendment of the grant agreements on January&nbsp;10, 2014. Certain of these options were considered to have service inception dates in
2013, which resulted in the vested portion of these options being remeasured throughout 2013. Share-based compensation expense of $1.9 million was recorded for the vested portion of these options for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P>

which this amount is expected to be recognized was 2.74 years. This amount includes the fair value of the unvested portion of those awards that did not have an accounting grant date until January&nbsp;10, 2014 based on fair value of those options at
December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>9. License Agreement </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
July&nbsp;2008, the Company entered into a sublicense agreement with HemoCleanse, Inc. (HemoCleanse) for an exclusive worldwide license under certain patent rights held by HemoCleanse for the zirconium silicate compound that HemoCleanse had licensed
from UOP, LLC (UOP). In exchange for the sublicense rights, the Company issued 779,919 shares of Common Stock to HemoCleanse, Inc. (see Note&nbsp;7). The sublicense allowed the Company to research, develop, and commercialize the zirconium silicate
compound within specified therapeutic fields and to practice certain licensed processes with those therapeutic fields. In December&nbsp;2011, the Company entered into a license restructuring agreement with HemoCleanse and UOP that terminated the
license and sublicense agreements between the parties and created a license agreement between the Company and UOP, whereby the Company received the same exclusive worldwide rights directly from UOP, and a sublicense agreement between the Company and
HemoCleanse, whereby HemoCleanse received an exclusive sublicense from the Company for a specified subfield of the UOP rights. The license agreement with UOP expires when the UOP patent rights expire. Under the terms of the license agreement, the
Company will pay to UOP a 5% royalty on the Company&#146;s net sales subject to a minimum annual royalty. Total royalty expense charged to operations under terms of these licensing agreements was $100,000 for each of the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, there was an outstanding balance payable to UOP of $100,000 related to these agreements. The Company has received no royalty income under the sublicensing agreement with HemoCleanse
since the inception of the sublicense agreement with HemoCleanse. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method and current income taxes are recorded based on amounts
refundable or payable in the current year. Deferred income taxes are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of loss carryforwards and temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those carryforwards and temporary differences to be recovered or
settled. Management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance, if considered necessary, based on such evaluation. As part of the evaluation, management has evaluated taxable income in
carryback years, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, feasible tax planning strategies, and future expectations of income. Based upon this evaluation, as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the company has recorded a valuation allowance of
$39.6 million to reduce the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In 2014, the total valuation allowance increased by $22.1 million primarily due to the increase in net operating loss and
federal credit carryforwards which the Company does not believe are more likely than not to be utilized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company has
federal and state income tax net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, net of the 382 limitation discussed below, of approximately $93.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and federal research tax credit carryforwards, net of the 382 limitation
discussed below, of approximately $5.2 million. Additionally, the Company has a Federal NOL carryforward of $3.3 million related to the excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation and stock option exercises. The benefit of this NOL
will be recognized as an increase to the additional paid-in capital at the point when such NOL provides cash benefit to the Company. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The NOL carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2029. The Company has experienced
multiple changes in ownership as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;382, prior to the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2014. The ownership changes have subjected our net operating loss carryforwards and federal research tax credit
carryforwards to an annual limitation. In general, the annual use limitation equals the aggregate value of our stock at the time of the ownership change multiplied by a specified tax-exempt interest rate. We estimate the ownership changes will
result in $1.5 million of net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused and $0.1 million of federal research tax credit carryforwards expiring unused. Such unusable net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit carryforwards are
therefore not included in the amount disclosed in the paragraph above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company had no accrued income taxes payable at December&nbsp;31, 2014. The
federal and state income tax returns of the Company for 2014 are subject to examination by the taxing authority, generally for a period of three years for federal and four years for states from the date the tax returns were filed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits, that the position will not be sustained upon
examination. At December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had no uncertain tax positions. <B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>11. Defined Contribution Plan </B></P>

participate. Eligible participants may contribute a percentage of their annual compensation to this plan, subject to statutory limitations. Irrespective of the amount of any participant contributions in a plan year, we will contribute an amount
equal to 3% of each participant&#146;s annual salary into their account in the plan each plan year, subject to federal limits per employee for safe harbor plans such as the plan we have offered. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, we made
safe harbor contributions into the plan totaling $0.2 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>12. Commitments and Contingencies </B></P>

clinical materials and $1.3 million with equipment vendors for the manufacture of equipment to produce our product. All other significant contracts as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 were terminable, with varying provisions regarding termination. If a
contract with a specific vendor were to be terminated, we would only be obligated for the product or services that we had received at the time the termination became effective. <B> </B></P>
