accompanying this Notice, the Board of Directors of Versartis, Inc. (the &#147;<B>Board of Directors</B>&#148;) is seeking approval of an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. A substantively identical amendment (the
&#147;<B>May Amendment</B>&#148;) was approved at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May&nbsp;25, 2017 (the &#147;<B>Prior Approval</B>&#148;). The May Amendment, which increased the number of shares of common stock that the Company was
authorized to issue from 50,000,000 shares to 100,000,000 shares, was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and became effective on May&nbsp;31, 2017. While we believe the Prior Approval was properly obtained, there may be
uncertainty with respect to the validity or effectiveness of the Prior Approval. Specifically, certain shares of common stock held through brokers/nominees with respect to which no voting instructions were provided may have been voted by the
broker/nominee in favor of the May Amendment in accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Certain statements in the Company&#146;s definitive proxy statement for the Company&#146;s 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders were
inconsistent with the treatment of the votes cast by brokers/nominees and indicated that if a beneficial owner holding shares through a broker/nominee did not instruct such broker or nominee how to vote on the May Amendment, it would have the same
effect as casting a vote &#147;Against&#148; the May Amendment. At the Special Meeting, we are submitting an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would confirm that the Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000
shares of common stock. If approved, this amendment will allow us to avoid any uncertainty with respect to the number of shares of common stock that the Company is authorized to issue and will confirm that the Company is authorized to issue
100,000,000 shares of common stock. To the extent the May Amendment is not currently valid, this amendment will have the effect of increasing the authorized number of shares of common stock from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000, which is the same number of
authorized shares that we believe were approved in the Prior Approval and is set forth in the May Amendment. </P>

they may have in the voting of the shares that you beneficially own. Brokers and nominees can use their discretion to vote &#147;uninstructed&#148; shares with respect to matters that are considered to be &#147;routine,&#148; but not with respect to
&#147;non-routine&#148; matters. Under the rules and interpretations of the NYSE, &#147;non-routine&#148; matters are matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of stockholder, such as mergers, stockholder proposals, elections of
directors (even if not contested), executive compensation (including any advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation and on the frequency of stockholder votes on executive compensation), and certain corporate governance proposals, even if
management-supported. We believe Proposal 1 and Proposal 2 will be considered &#147;routine&#148; matters. If these proposals are considered &#147;routine&#148; matters, your broker or nominee may vote your shares in its discretion either for or
against Proposal 1 and Proposal 2 even in the absence of your instruction. This means that if you are a beneficial owner and want to ensure that all of the shares you beneficially own are voted in favor or against Proposal 1 and/or Proposal 2, you

Incorporation that would confirm that the authorized number of the Company&#146;s shares of common stock is 100,000,000 shares, or the Charter Amendment. This description is qualified by the full text of the Charter Amendment that is attached as
Appendix A to this proxy statement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Background </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or the 2017 Annual Meeting, we sought stockholder approval of an amendment to our Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock by 50,000,000 shares from 50,000,000 shares to 100,000,000 shares (we refer to this increase as the &#147;Authorized Share Increase,&#148; the
amendment that set forth the Authorized Share Increase as the &#147;May 2017 Amendment&#148; and the proposal presented at the 2017 Annual Meeting as the &#147;Prior Proposal&#148;). At the 2017 Annual Meeting, our independent inspector of elections
determined that the Prior Proposal received the requisite stockholder approval and certified that the Prior Proposal passed. We subsequently filed the May 2017 Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May&nbsp;31, 2017. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of our independent inspector of elections&#146; determination of our voting results, votes cast by brokers/nominees without
instruction from the beneficial owners of certain of our outstanding shares were counted in favor of the Prior Proposal in accordance with the rules of the NYSE that govern how brokers may cast such votes. Certain statements made in the definitive
proxy statement for the 2017 Annual Meeting, which was filed on Schedule 14A with the SEC on April&nbsp;25, 2017, or the 2017 Proxy Statement, were inconsistent with this treatment. The 2017 Proxy Statement stated that brokers/nominees would not
have discretion to vote for approval of the Prior Proposal without instruction, and that the resulting broker non-votes would be counted &#147;against&#148; the proposal. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although our independent inspector of elections certified that the Prior Proposal passed, our Board of Directors has determined that the
description of the authority of brokers and nominees to vote on the Prior Proposal without instruction in the 2017 Proxy Statement may create some uncertainty as to the effect of the vote obtained at the 2017 Annual Meeting and, accordingly,
uncertainty regarding the validity of the May 2017 Amendment and the Authorized Share Increase. As a result, the Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to ask our stockholders to
approve the Charter Amendment at this Special Meeting in order to eliminate any uncertainty regarding the number of shares of common stock that the Company is authorized to issue. None of the additional authorized shares of common stock added by the
Authorized Share Increase have been issued or are outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Proposal </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the time of the 2017 Annual Meeting, our Board of Directors believed that the proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common
stock was desirable in order to enhance our flexibility in taking possible future actions, such as raising additional equity capital, exchanging equity for debt or other transactions that have similar effect, stock-based acquisitions, stock splits
and dividends, equity compensation awards or other corporate purposes. Our Board of Directors believes this continues to be the case. In order to confirm that the Authorized Share Increase has occurred, the Board of Directors has declared advisable,
approved and adopted, and recommended that our stockholders approve, the Charter Amendment. The Charter Amendment would confirm that the Company is authorized to issue a total of 100,000,000 shares of common stock and, to the extent the May 2017
Amendment is not valid, the Charter Amendment would affect the Authorized Share Increase. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At this time, we do not have any specific need

plan, we will be able to act in a timely manner when such a need arises or when our Board of Directors believes it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to take action,
without the delay and expense that would be required at that time to obtain stockholder approval of such an increase. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If issued, the
additional common stock authorized, or to be authorized, by the Authorized Share Increase would have rights identical to the currently outstanding common stock of the Company. Stockholders have no preemptive rights to acquire shares of common stock
issued by the Company under its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. This means that current stockholders do not have a prior right to purchase any new issue of our capital stock in order to maintain their proportionate ownership of
common stock. Adoption of the Charter Amendment and issuance of the common stock would not affect the rights of the holders of currently outstanding common stock of the Company, except for effects incidental to increasing the number of shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock outstanding, such as dilution of the earnings per share and voting rights of current holders of common stock. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or the perception that additional shares may be issued,
may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Shares of common stock could be issued by our Board without further vote of our stockholders except as may be required in particular cases by our Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, applicable law, regulatory agencies or the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the 35,514,630&nbsp;shares of

to provide additional flexibility to use the Company&#146;s common stock for business and financial purposes in the future as well to have sufficient shares available to provide appropriate equity incentives for our employees. The additional shares
created by the Authorized Share Increase may be used for various purposes without further stockholder approval. These purposes may include raising capital; providing equity incentives to employees, officers, directors, consultants and/or advisors;
establishing strategic relationships with other companies; expanding our business through the acquisition of other businesses, products or technologies; and other purposes. For example, we will need to raise substantial additional funds to, among
other things, finance our operations, clinical trials and the initial commercial activities for our product somavaratan (VRS-317), for growth hormone deficiency, if it is approved. Thus, we may need to obtain significant amounts of additional
capital and the additional shares may be used for a financing if we have an appropriate opportunity. Although we may pursue other sources of funding, such as corporate collaborations and partnerships, if we are not successful with these efforts or
if our Board of Directors otherwise determines that a financing through issuing additional shares is attractive, we want to be in a position to act quickly depending on market conditions. </P>

currently be available for issuance if the May 2017 Amendment was not effective) could also be used by us to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or to delay or prevent changes in control or our management of the Company. For example, without further
stockholder approval, the Board of Directors could strategically sell shares of common stock in a private transaction to purchasers who would oppose a takeover or favor the current Board of Directors. Although the Prior Proposal and the proposal to
confirm that the Authorized Share Increase have been prompted by business and financial considerations and not by the threat of any hostile takeover attempt (nor is the Board of Directors currently aware of any such attempts directed at us),
nevertheless, stockholders should be aware that approval of this Proposal&nbsp;1 could facilitate future efforts by us to deter or prevent changes in control of the Company, including transactions in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a

the Charter Amendment is adopted, it will become effective upon the effectiveness of the filing of a Certificate of Amendment of the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and the shares of common stock created by the Authorized Share Increase would be available for issuance. No further stockholder authorization would be required prior to the issuance of such shares by the Company, except where stockholder

solicited by our Board of Directors to vote in favor of adjourning the Special Meeting to another time and place, if necessary or appropriate (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), to solicit additional proxies in the event there
are not sufficient votes to approve Proposal 1. If our stockholders approve this proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned or postponed session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies,
including the solicitation of proxies from our stockholders that have previously voted. Among other things, approval of this proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes to defeat Proposal 1, we
could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on such proposal and seek to convince our stockholders to change their votes in favor of such proposal. </P>

adjourned meeting is required to be given to our stockholders, other than an announcement at the Special Meeting of the time and place to which the Special Meeting is adjourned, so long as the meeting is adjourned for 30 days or less and no new
record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. At the adjourned meeting, we may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. </P>

non-votes on this proposal. If, however, your shares are represented at the Special Meeting and your broker fails to vote your shares on this proposal, it will have the same effect as an &#147;against&#148; vote on this proposal. </P>
